Live Call Routing
=================

Trigger incidents from live calls and voicemails with a dedicated number

Live Call Routing (LCR) allows organizations to expand their customer support by directing incoming phone calls and voicemails to on-call responders. We provide a fixed, dedicated number (local or [toll-free](#toll-free-numbers), where available), which will dynamically route calls or voicemails to the PagerDuty on-call responder and trigger incidents.

> 🚧 Requirements
> --------------
> 
> **You must have Live Call Routing enabled on your account before you can configure it.**
> 
> * Live Call Routing is available as an add-on to customers on Professional and Business plans, and it’s included on the following pricing plans: Enterprise for Incident Management and Digital Operations (Legacy). Please [contact our Sales Team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-sales/) if you would like to upgrade to a plan with this feature.
> * All users (with the exception of Limited Users) can view, add, edit and delete numbers on the Live Call Routing page once enabled.
> * Some accounts may have opted to require users to log in to view the Live Call Routing page, and to restrict page editing to Manager, Global Admin and Account Owner base roles. Please contact your Account Manager if you would like to adjust these settings.

Add a Live Call Routing Number
==============================

US Service Region
-----------------

1. Navigate to **Integrations**  **Your Integrations**  **Live Call Routing**.
2. Click **New Routing Number** (if this button is not visible, you have reached your maximum number of lines. Please [contact our Sales Team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-sales/) if you would like to purchase additional lines).
3. Select the [**Country**](#regular-phone-numbers) where you'd like the number to be based, and enter the **area code** *(optional)*, if available.
4. Click **Continue** to create the number.
5. Enter a **Name** for the routing number. You will see your Live Call Routing number automatically generated below this name.
6. Under **What should happen when a call is connected?** choose one of the following options:

* **[Play greeting and go to voicemail. Send the voicemail recording to the current on-call responder.](/main/docs/live-call-routing#section-play-greeting-and-go-to-voicemail)**
* **[Play greeting and call the current on-call responder](/main/docs/live-call-routing#section-play-greeting-and-call-the-current-on-call-responder)**. This option requires additional configuration:
  + Choose one of the following call display options:
    - **Show the incoming caller's number on the call display (Default)**
    - **[Show `[YOUR-LCR-NUMBER-HERE]` on call display](/main/docs/live-call-routing#section-show-the-live-call-routing-number-on-your-phones-display)**.
  + **How long before call escalates to the next level (seconds)**: Select how many seconds you would like to pass before escalating.
  + **Skip Numbers that were already dialed on other EP levels** (*optional*).
  + **Resolve Incident when call is completed with on-call user** (*optional*).

> 🚧 Toll-Free LCR number regulations in Australia
> -----------------------------------------------
> 
> Due to local regulations, toll-free LCR numbers cannot send calls in Australia. Customers using these numbers should not select **[Show `[YOUR-LCR-NUMBER-HERE]` on call display](/main/docs/live-call-routing#section-show-the-live-call-routing-number-on-your-phones-display)** option from the step above.

7. Under **How should caller be greeted on the call?** choose one of the following options:

* **Read a greeting message for me**: Enter the message that you would like the caller to hear when they call via automated message. If you would [prefer that service names are not listed in this message](/main/docs/live-call-routing#section-prevent-live-call-routing-from-reading-your-services-names), check the **Only play this greeting, do not read out the service name(s)** checkbox.
* [**Upload my own audio file to use as the greeting**](/main/docs/live-call-routing#section-upload-your-own-audio-message): You may upload your own MP3 audio file to play instead of an automated message. Click **Choose File**, select your **audio file** and then proceed with the following steps.

8. Select an associated **Service** where you would like incidents to trigger. This automatically assigns the service to Keypad # 1. [To add more services](/main/docs/live-call-routing#section-tie-multiple-services-to-a-live-call-routing-number), click **Add Another Service**.
9. When you are finished adding your services, click **Update Routing Number**. This will save your Live Call Routing number.

To add additional Live Call Routing lines, or to request a toll-free Live Call Routing number, please [reach out to our Sales Team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-sales/).

2. Click **Ok** on the prompt that appears to delete the number.

Supported Countries
===================

A Live Call Routing phone number’s availability will vary depending on your country and [service region](/main/docs/service-regions).

**Note**: While the lists below represent countries where we can currently create an inbound Live Call Routing number, responders can *receive* Live Call Routing-generated calls in any [supported country](/main/docs/supported-countries).

> 📘 Availability
> --------------
> 
> If you would like to set up a Live Call Routing number in a country that is not listed here, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager or [PagerDuty Support](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-us/#contact-support) to confirm current availability.

> 📘 Calls to China no Longer Supported
> ------------------------------------
> 
> As of November 2023, calls to responders with Chinese prefix numbers (+86) are no longer supported in the Live Call Routing application. This change is due to [Twilio's updated policy](https://help.twilio.com/articles/360016488474-Calling-Limitations-to-China) , which no longer supports calls to Chinese numbers.

Regular Phone Numbers

* Canada
* Czech Republic/Czechia
* Israel
* Puerto Rico
* United Kingdom of Great Britain and North Ireland
* United States of America

Toll-Free Numbers
-----------------

Subject to availability, you can configure a toll-free Live Call Routing phone number in the following countries. Toll-free numbers are administered separately from [regular phone numbers](#regular-phone-numbers). Please contact our [Sales Team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-us/#contact-sales) if you would like to upgrade to a plan with this feature.

### US Service Region

* United States of America

Configuration Behavior
======================

There are two ways to configure Live Call Routing's connection type:

* [Play greeting and go to voicemail](/main/docs/live-call-routing#section-play-greeting-and-go-to-voicemail). (The current on-call responder will receive the voicemail recording)
* [Play greeting and call the current on-call responder](/main/docs/live-call-routing#section-play-greeting-and-call-the-current-on-call-responder)

Play Greeting and Go to Voicemail
---------------------------------

This setting triggers an incident after the caller leaves a voicemail. The caller's message will attach to a newly triggered incident, which is assigned to the on-call responder on the first level of the [escalation policy](/main/docs/escalation-policies). If more than one person is on-call, PagerDuty assigns the incident to all responders on the **first escalation rule**. The incident then escalates according to the service's escalation policy.

> 📘 Disable Voicemail (US Service Region only)
> --------------------------------------------
> 
> Customers in the US [service region](/main/docs/service-regions) may optionally disable voicemail in their Live Call Routing configuration, if it represents a security risk, for example. If you wish to disable callers’ ability to leave a voicemail, please [contact our Support team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-us/#contact-support).

### Listen to a Voicemail

To listen to an incident’s appended voicemail, you will need to navigate to either the **Incidents** page or view the incident itself and then click the **Show Details** link. Click the **Listen to Recording** link and you will be able to listen to the voicemail.

To listen to the voicemail from the mobile app, tap the incident to view the incident details. Then, tap the **Listen to Recording** link.

Play Greeting and Call the Current On-Call Responder
----------------------------------------------------

This setting creates an **acknowledged** incident when a responder answers the call. You can configure the incident to automatically **resolve** when the call ends. If a responder has more than one phone number on their user profile, PagerDuty will call them at the first number listed on their [Contact Information](/main/docs/user-profile#contact-information) tab.

### Escalation Behaviors

* PagerDuty will attempt to connect the caller with the on-call responder on the first level of the escalation policy.
* You can configure how long each responder has to answer the call before it escalates to the next responder. The default is 20 seconds.
* If more than one responder is on-call, PagerDuty will randomly cycle through all responders on an escalation level.
* If your account uses [Round Robin Scheduling](/main/docs/round-robin-scheduling), please note that Live Call Routing may attempt to contact *all* on-call responders on an escalation level in certain situations. This is Live Call Routing's default behavior when there are multiple users or schedules on an escalation level and Live Call Routing is configured to connect directly to the on-call user.
* If the responder does not answer the call, PagerDuty will attempt to contact on-call responders at each remaining level of the escalation policy until someone answers. Please note that **PagerDuty will not attempt to call the first level responders again**. Even if you configured the escalation policy to repeat one or more times, it will only go through the escalation policy **one time**.
* If still no one answers, PagerDuty will prompt the caller to leave a message. An incident will trigger, with the incident description containing the inbound caller ID, and it will assign to the on-call responder on the first level of the escalation policy.
* The incident will then escalate as expected according to the service's escalation policy.

### Show the Live Call Routing Number on Your Phone's Display

For calls that connect directly with responders, you can select an option to show the Live Call Routing number, instead of the caller's number, when they receive a call. This can be helpful to add to a contacts list, for example, so it is clear when a call relates to PagerDuty and Live Call Routing.

> 🚧 Country Requirement
> ---------------------
> 
> This feature is currently only available for US- and Canada-based Live Call Routing numbers. The number that appears on the call display of responders' phones is not configurable for Live Call Routing numbers outside of Canada and U.S.A. due to restrictions in these countries. It will usually show as the number of the original caller (rather than the Live Call Routing number).

Prevent Live Call Routing from Reading Your Services' Names
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you select **Read a greeting message for me** (Step 7 of [Add a Live Call Routing Number](/main/docs/live-call-routing#section-add-a-live-call-routing-number)) Live Call Routing will, by default, attempt to read your services' names to the caller so they can connect to the correct escalation policy. If your services reference internal jargon, this information may not make sense to the caller.

You can configure Live Call Routing to only play the greeting and not read out services' names. Please note that if you select this option, you'll need to update the greeting with more caller-friendly information.

> 📘 Text-to-Speech Pronunciation
> ------------------------------
> 
> We recommend listening to the text-to-speech greeting to ensure the pronunciation of special phrases or abbreviations are correct and in the desired format. For example, you may need to enter "knock" for "NOC" or "V I P" for "VIP".

Upload Your Own Audio Message
-----------------------------

You may choose to upload your own audio file to play for the caller, instead of an automated message. Select **Upload my own audio file to use as the greeting** and upload an MP3 file.

Tie Multiple Services to a Live Call Routing Number
===================================================

You can associate up to nine services with a single Live Call Routing number. This creates a phone-tree-like structure, which prompts the caller to select an option. When dialing in, an automated voice will announce, "Press 1 for Nagios Critical. Press 2 for Datadog Alerts… etc." Depending on the caller's selection, after a brief moment they'll connect with the appropriate response team. If the caller does not make a selection, the greeting will loop three times and then end the call.

To change the order in which services announce (most critical first, for instance), you can rearrange the list of services on a routing number's **Edit** screen.

Troubleshooting Guide
=====================

"You have reached a PagerDuty Live Call Routing line that is not set up yet; please call back later"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you hear this message when calling your Live Call Routing number, here are some things you should check:

1. Is your Live Call Routing instance associated with at least one service?
2. Are the service(s) using your Live Call Routing instance [disabled or in a maintenance window](/main/docs/maintenance-windows)?
3. Is anyone on call for this service? Note that [an incident cannot trigger if no one is on call](/main/docs/why-incidents-fail-to-trigger#no-one-was-on-call).
4. Do the on-call responders in the service's escalation policy have a phone contact method listed in the [Contact Information](/main/docs/user-profile#contact-information) section of their user profile? Note that **Live Call Routing will not check the SMS field**, so on-call responders must have a number listed in the **Phone** field of their contact information in order for it to work.

FAQ

Expand/Collapse All

What happens when none of the users in an escalation policy have a phone number in their contact methods?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Connect Directly**: Caller hears a message, “You have reached a PagerDuty Live Call Routing line that is not set up yet. Please call back later” (no incident triggers).

**Leave Message**: Caller hears the Message to Caller and a *beep* prompting them to leave a message (an incident triggers and assigns to the first escalation level with an on-call user).

What happens when the first contacted person does not have a phone number in their contact methods to contact?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Connect Directly**: Caller hears, “Attempting to connect you to an on-call responder”, LCR skips the first level and tries the next level until it finds someone who has entered a phone number.

**Leave Message**: Caller hears the Message to Caller and a *beep* prompting them to leave a message (an incident triggers and assigns to the first escalation level with an on-call user).

What happens if I send an SMS message to a Live Call Routing number?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Live Call Routing is designed to handle voice calls and does not support SMS messages. Text messages sent to a Live Call Routing number will not trigger an incident or route to the on-call responder.

What happens if no one is on-call in the escalation policy?
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Connect Directly**: Caller hears, ”You have reached a PagerDuty Live Call Routing line that is not set up yet. Please call back later” (no incident triggers).

**Leave Message**: Caller hears Message to Caller and a *beep* prompting them to leave a message (no incident triggers).

What happens if no one is on-call on the first level of the escalation policy, but there are people on-call at a higher level?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Connect Directly**: Caller hears, “Attempting to connect you to an on-call responder,” and LCR skips the first level and tries the next level until it finds someone who is on-call.

**Leave Message**: Caller hears Message to Caller and a *beep* prompting them to leave a message. An incident triggers and assigns to the first escalation level with an on-call user.

What happens if I set the Live Call Routing service to low-urgency, or if it has support hours and it’s on a low-urgency setting during the time of the call?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Connect Directly**: Live Call Routing calls the first level on-call user, and if there is no answer, LCR calls any on-call user at higher levels of the escalation policy. If there is still no answer, the caller receives a prompt to leave a message, and an incident triggers.

**Leave Message**: Caller hears Message to Caller and a *beep* prompting them to leave a message. A low-urgency incident triggers and assigns to the first escalation level with an on-call user. PagerDuty sends notifications according to the on-call user’s low-urgency notification settings.

Will Live Call Routing follow the timing rules I have set between escalation policy levels?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, Live Call Routing does not follow the timing rules between escalation policy levels when you select the connect directly option. To ensure that your callers connect to a responder as quickly as possible, if the user on the first escalation level does not answer the call, Live Call Routing will immediately try to contact the on-call responder at the next escalation level, and so on.
