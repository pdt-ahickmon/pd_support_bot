Mobile App Walkthrough
======================

The walkthrough screenshots below are from our Android app, and the iOS app is very similar.

Navigation Tabs
---------------

With modernized navigation, menu options are located in a tab bar at the bottom of the screen. The following tabs are available at the tap of a button:

* **Home**
* **Incidents**
* **My Shifts**
* **Services**
* **More**
  + Escalation Policies
  + Resolved Incidents
  + Schedules
  + Status Dashboard
  + Teams
  + Users

![Navigation Tab Bar: Home, Incidents, My Shifts, Services and More](https://files.readme.io/6b3d25d-mobile-app-modernized-navigation.png)



Navigation Tab Bar: Home, Incidents, My Shifts, Services and More



When switching between these tabs, the history of your place on each page will be preserved. For example, if you were on the **Incidents** tab viewing an incident **Timeline** and then you switched to the **Services** tab, when you return to the **Incidents** tab you would still be viewing that incident's **Timeline**.

Home Screen
-----------

The mobile Home screen highlights top open incidents, and displays on-call shift and service information, which broadens awareness and streamlines navigation to other important, non-incident information. Please read [Mobile Home Screen](/main/docs/mobile-home-screen) for more information.

![Mobile Home Screen](https://files.readme.io/9c1910f-home_screen.png "Mobile Home Screen")



Mobile Home Screen



Open Incidents Screen
---------------------

To view open incidents, select **Incidents** from the bottom navigation.

The **Mine** tab shows all triggered and acknowledged incidents assigned to you. The **All** tab shows all triggered and acknowledged incidents in the account. If you have a [Responder role](/main/docs/advanced-permissions) or higher, you will also see the **My Teams** tab, which will show all incidents assigned to your teams.

This screen remembers your tab selection (**Mine**, **My Teams** or **All**), so you can access relevant incidents faster when navigating here from other screens.

### Sort Incidents

You may sort open incidents by tapping **Sort By [x]** and selecting **Urgency**, **Priority** or **Recent**.

If you are sorting by urgency, high urgency incidents will be displayed at the top of the queue and low urgency incidents at the bottom, regardless of their status (triggered or acknowledged).

Settings in the mobile app



Mobile App Permissions
======================

As of app version 5.72, new downloads of the mobile app will ask for the permission to access your contacts. For existing app users, you can access this under the **Settings** tab in the mobile app.

The way we use the **Manage Contacts** permission is by importing the [PagerDuty vCard](/main/docs/notification-phone-numbers). We will automatically keep this up to date when we add or remove numbers from the vCard.

* We will **not** send messages, calls, or notifications to any contact within your contacts list.
* We will **not** use this permission for marketing, data gathering, or for research purposes.

If you choose to deny this permission, the app will still function as intended. However, you may miss calls if the PagerDuty phone number is blocked or marked as spam by your provider. For iOS users, installing the contact card allows you to enable an override for Do Not Disturb, and will ensure silencing unknown numbers doesn't affect calls from PagerDuty. You can always manually download the vCard from our Knowledge Base, however you will need to periodically check to see if it has been updated, and if so, you’ll need to download it again.

![Mobile app permissions](https://files.readme.io/811aa0ce4683386fa2df542c283ea8407057e12ef32ab5c15b2191091111c49e-access_contacts.png "Mobile app permissions")



Mobile app permissions



Advanced Mobile Security
========================

Add an additional layer of mobile app security by setting up Advanced Mobile Security on your PagerDuty account.

Enabling this feature will require users to set a passcode (“PIN”) after logging in to the mobile app. This passcode is stored locally on the user’s device and will need to be entered to access the app every time users close it or leave it in the background. On iOS, users can choose to use phone biometric features like Face-ID. Administrators can also set a timeout which will additionally require the passcode when the timeout has elapsed even if the user has not minimized or closed the app.

> 🚧 Requirements
> --------------
> 
> The App Lock feature is available to customers on the following pricing plans: Business, Digital Operations (legacy) and Enterprise for Incident Management.
> 
> **Note**: Advanced Mobile Security is configured within the web app as opposed to the mobile app.

To set up App Lock:

1. In the PagerDuty web app, navigate to **User Icon**   **Account Settings**  **Mobile Security Settings**.
2. Select **On** from the drop-down to enable the **Mobile App Lock Setting**.
3. Choose an **App Lock Timeout** value which will control how long it will take for the app to lock and require to enter a passcode.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

![Mobile security settings](https://files.readme.io/637ab54-pd-mobile-app-mobile-app-security.png "Mobile security settings")

Once the setting is enabled, users will be prompted to enter a new passcode when they log into their PagerDuty mobile app.

FAQ
===

Expand/Collapse All

When logging in, do I need to select my service region?
-------------------------------------------------------

You do not need to specify if you are logging into an EU or US region based account. The login system works globally, and will log you in to the appropriate account depending on the credentials you enter. If you use the same email/password combination for accounts in both EU and US regions, you will be presented with a list of accounts, which will indicate which region each account is based in.

I use Single Sign-On to log in. Why don’t I see the option to enter my email/password, too?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your PagerDuty administrator has configured the account to only allow login via single sign-on. Please contact your PagerDuty administration if you wish to use email and password to sign in to PagerDuty.

I have multiple accounts with the same email. Why don't I see a list of accounts to log into?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users will see a list of accounts that use the exact same email/password combination. If you have used different passwords, but the same email address, for different accounts, the app will not present a list of accounts.

Can I use a password manager to log in?
---------------------------------------

Yes, the PagerDuty mobile app is compatible with industry standard password managers, even if you have multiple PagerDuty accounts. If you use a unique password for each PagerDuty account, the app will log you in to the appropriate account.

If I have multiple PagerDuty accounts, should I use the same password for each?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, we do not recommend using the same password across multiple accounts for security reasons, though we understand it may be required in certain configurations.
