Salesforce Service Cloud Integration Guide | PagerDuty
======================================================

Salesforce Service Cloud + PagerDuty Integration Benefits
=========================================================

* Orchestrate responses and actions around customer issues, sales opportunities, and other activities across your organization.
* Customize when to notify the proper on-call team about relevant activities occurring in Salesforce Service Cloud.
* Create and/or update Salesforce Service Cloud objects with relevant information as soon as there’s a PagerDuty incident update such as an acknowledge, resolve, reassign, etc.
* Each PagerDuty subdomain can be connected to multiple Salesforce Service Cloud objects to streamline cross-organizational collaboration.
* Access a Command Console interface that allows agents to create PagerDuty incidents and view linked incidents directly from a case record. The Command Console can be used to help identify customer-impacting issues and escalate urgent issues to engineering / IT.
* Access a Status Dashboard that provides agents with status updates for ongoing, customer-impacting incidents and context that enables tailored customer communications.

Version
=======

* This guide outlines configuration for the **Salesforce Service Cloud v3.x** integration.
* If you would like to upgrade from a previous version, please follow instructions in our [Upgrade to v3.x](#upgrade-to-v3x) section.

> 📘 Looking for a Different Version?
> ----------------------------------
> 
> The following integrations are also available:
> 
> * [Salesforce Service Cloud v2](/main/docs/salesforce-service-cloud-v2-integration-guide)
> * [Salesforce Service Cloud v1](/main/docs/salesforce-service-cloud-v1-integration-guide)

How it Works
============

* Once a Salesforce Service Cloud object is connected to your PagerDuty instance, new record creations and updates on that object are evaluated against rules that you predefine. If the rule criteria is met, PagerDuty will perform actions specified by those predefined rules, including creating new PagerDuty incidents and updating the fields of Salesforce Service Cloud objects.
* PagerDuty can also send information to Salesforce Cloud, where you can define the evaluation criteria against the updates made in PagerDuty and select an action to be performed in Salesforce Cloud.

Requirements
============

> 📘 Pricing Plan
> --------------
> 
> The Salesforce Service Cloud v3.x integration is available to accounts on the following pricing plans: Customer Service Professional, Customer Service Business, Customer Service Digital Operations (legacy) and Enterprise Customer Service. Please [contact our Sales Team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-us/) if you would like to upgrade to a plan featuring the Salesforce Service Cloud integration.

### Required Permissions to Configure or Upgrade the Integration

**In Salesforce Cloud**:

* Permissions to install Salesforce Managed Package applications.
* A Salesforce Professional, Unlimited or Enterprise edition, which can allow Apex classes to be run from a Managed Package.
* Ensure that API Access is enabled on your Organization. Salesforce Organizations in Trial Mode will normally not have API access enabled.

**In PagerDuty**:

A Global Admin or Account Owner base role is required for configuration.

### Required Permissions to Use the Integration

If you are using custom permissions in Salesforce, please see the FAQ below for more information: [What kind of custom permissions do users need to use this integration?](/main/docs/salesforce-service-cloud-integration-guide#what-kind-of-custom-permissions-do-users-need-to-use-this-integration)

Integration Walkthrough
=======================

In PagerDuty
============

Create an API Key
-----------------

1. First, you will need to generate a REST PagerDuty API Key to allow Salesforce Service Cloud to connect to PagerDuty. Navigate to **Integrations**  **API Access Keys** and click **Create New API Key**.
2. Enter a **Description** (e.g. “Salesforce Service Cloud API Key”) and click **Create Key**.
3. On the next screen, copy the **API Key** and paste it in a safe place for later use. **Note**: You will not have access to this key after this screen.

![Copy API key](https://files.readme.io/57b0cce-salesforce-ig-new-api-key.png "salesforce-ig-new-api-key.png")



Copy API key



In Salesforce Service Cloud
===========================

Download the PagerDuty Application
----------------------------------

4. Open a new tab in order to reference the details in the PagerDuty web app that you just created. In your new tab, [download the PagerDuty Application](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FK9u7UAD) to your Salesforce Service Cloud Account. You will be prompted to select which users you want to download the application for. We recommend that you select **Install for All Users**. You will have more options to restrict which users can access PagerDuty functionality later during installation. Click **Install**.
5. You will then be asked to approve third party access to PagerDuty APIs. Please check the box **Yes, grant access to these third-party web sites** and click **Continue**.
6. If you see a message that says, “The app is taking a long time to install,” you will receive an email from Salesforce Service Cloud when the app has finished installation:

![Example email](https://files.readme.io/3e13542-salesforcev3-install-success-email.png "salesforcev3-install-success-email.png")



Example email



Manage Connected App Permissions and Credentials
------------------------------------------------

7. Navigate to **Setup Home**  **Apps**  ​​**App Manager**  **PagerDuty Platform V3**  select **Manage** from the right-hand dropdown. Select **Edit Policies**. In the Permitted Users field, select **Admin approved users are pre-authorized**, click **Ok** when prompted and then click **Save**. This is a necessary step to ensure that PagerDuty rulesets function appropriately.
8. Lower on the same page, click the **Manage Profiles** button under the Profiles heading.
9. **Check the box** next to the **Profile** type (for example, `System Administrator`) belonging to the integration user, and then click **Save**. This user’s PagerDuty email will be required in step 18; their permissions will be used to update records in Salesforce Service Cloud based on your rulesets.
   
   Click **Save**.

Assign User Permissions for the PagerDuty Application
-----------------------------------------------------

10. All users logging in to the PagerDuty Command Console or Status Dashboard will need to have permissions to the relevant Salesforce Objects in the PagerDuty Managed Package. If the only user/user profile who plans to use this application is the user/user profile you selected in step 9, you can skip to step 14.
11. As a Salesforce Administrator, navigate to **Setup**  **Users**  **Permission Sets**. Select the `PagerDutyUser` or `PagerDutyAdmin` permission set, click **Manage Assignments** and click **Add Assignments**. Select all users you want to assign the `PagerDutyUser` or `PagerDutyAdmin` permission set to, and then click **Assign**.

> 📘 Note
> ------
> 
> If you would prefer to use Salesforce Profiles, please [see our FAQ](#how-can-i-set-up-pagerdutyuser-equivalent-permissions-with-salesforce-profiles) for more information.

Add the PagerDuty Console to a Salesforce Service Cloud Case
------------------------------------------------------------

12. Next, you will need to add the PagerDuty application to the page where you’d like members of your team to have access. For this example, we’re going to add the PagerDuty app to the Salesforce Service Cloud Case.
13. Navigate to any Salesforce Service Cloud Case in the Service Console. Click into the case and navigate to the **cog** in the upper right hand corner and click **Edit Page**.
14. In the left side bar, search for “PagerDuty”. You can drag one of the following into the Case view in a placement of your choice:

* **PagerDuty Combined Console** (Recommended): The best of PagerDuty, including both the PagerDuty Command Console and the PagerDuty Status Dashboard. With the Combined Console, frontline agents immediately become aware of customer impacting issues, and can engage key experts across the organization when they hear about a new high-priority issue.
* **PagerDuty Command Console**: Only the PagerDuty Command Console. Recommended for any PagerDuty teams that do not plan to use the PagerDuty Status Dashboard.
* **PagerDuty Status Dashboard**: Only the PagerDuty Status Dashboard. Best for teams that want to understand which issues are customer-impacting, or teams setting up 24/7 after hours support for the first time.

15. Click **Save**, then click **Activate**, and when prompted, select the permissions that best fit your needs. We recommend:

* **Org Default**  click **Assign as Org Default**  ​​**Desktop**  **Next**  **Save**
* **App Default**  **Assign as App Default**  **Service Console** ​​ **Desktop and Phone**  **Next**  **Save**.

16. Navigate back to any case to confirm you can see the selected application.

Add the PagerDuty Console to a Salesforce Service Cloud Incident or other Non-Case Record
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17. If you would like the Command Console or Status Dashboard to work with other Salesforce Service Cloud Records (e.g. an Incident or Opportunities), you can repeat the previous section in this guide starting on the record where you want the console to appear.

Configure the PagerDuty Application
-----------------------------------

18. Click the **App Launcher** in the top left menu, search and select **PagerDuty Configuration** and perform the following:

**In the SUMMARY Tab:**

| Field | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Connection | Disregard the error message. It will be addressed in the next step. |
| Object Mappings | Disregard the error message, this will be addressed in the next step. |
| Webhook | Disregard the error message, this will be addressed in the next step. |

**In the Connection Tab:**

Under **API information**, enter your PagerDuty API key and select the data region for the account where the API key is from.

In the **Webhooks** section, enter the Salesforce Service Cloud **username** of a Salesforce user with the required permissions to carry out the changes needed with the integration, then click **Save**.

This webhook subscription saves the subdomain for the Salesforce account to the Salesforce Extension page in your PagerDuty account.

**In the OBJECT MAPPINGS Tab:**

| Field | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Sync Salesforce Case description to PagerDuty Incident description | Leave this enabled to continue syncing the Salesforce Case description with PagerDuty Incident description when an Incident or case is created. |
| Sync PagerDuty Notes to *(optional)*: - Salesforce Case Feed - Salesforce Case Comment | You can sync PagerDuty Notes to Salesforce Service Cloud Case Comments or Case Feed. Please note that syncing may consume your API request limits in Salesforce Service Cloud. |
| Enable PagerDuty triggers on Case Creation and Case Comments (optional) | You can Enable PagerDuty triggers for Case Creation and Case Comments. |
| Sync Salesforce Incident description to PagerDuty Incident description | Leave this enabled to continue syncing the Salesforce Incident description with PagerDuty Incident description when an Incident is created. |
| Enable PagerDuty triggers on Incident Creation *(optional)* | You can enable PagerDuty Incidents to sync with Salesforce Incident objects, instead of the default sync to Salesforce Case objects.**Notes**: - **Requirement**: Incident Management needs to be enabled to use this feature. - This will create an Apex Trigger on the Salesforce Incident Object. Because Salesforce doesn’t allow create or edit Apex actions in production, this step needs to be performed in a sandbox and then migrated to production. |
| PagerDuty Integration Email | Search and select the **email** that belongs to the integration user who has permission to create and update incidents in PagerDuty. |

Click **Save**.

Configure Rulesets
------------------

> 📘 Upgrading From V2 to V3
> -------------------------
> 
> If you have upgraded your PagerDuty application in Salesforce Service Cloud from V2 to V3, existing rulesets will still remain. If needed, you can create new rulesets by following the instructions below.

19. Now you can set up rules to create/modify incidents based on the content of a Salesforce record, or vice versa. Select the **RULESETS** tab. This is where you will build the rules that will specify what should happen to the object and fields when PagerDuty sends an update back to Salesforce Service Cloud. Click **Add Ruleset** on the right, enter a **Ruleset Name** and click **Save**. This Ruleset is a folder that will hold any rules you create. For ease of troubleshooting, we recommend that you maintain one ruleset for actions triggered from Salesforce to PagerDuty, (e.g., "SFDC > PD”) and one ruleset for actions triggered from PagerDuty to Salesforce (e.g., “PD > SFDC”).
20. Next, Click the **name** of the rule and then click **Add Rules**. Enter a **Rule Name**, click **Save** and then click the **name** of the rule. Each rule will ask for conditions that should be met prior to performing the actions specified in the latter part of the rule definition.

| Field | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Choose Salesforce Object | Search and select the **Salesforce Service Cloud object** that you would like to map to PagerDuty based on this rule’s criteria. |
| Run rule on | Depending on the direction you would like actions to be triggered, make the following selection: - Salesforce to PagerDuty Actions: Select **[OBJECT-LABEL] create or update**.OR - PagerDuty to Salesforce actions: Select **PagerDuty incident create or update**. |
| When | Depending on your preferences, select: - **All conditions are met**OR - **Any conditions are met** |

21. Click **Add Condition**. Under **Choose Field**, you will have the option to choose fields from PagerDuty, or from the Salesforce Service Cloud object that this rule will run on. The following PagerDuty Fields are available:

| Field | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Event Type | Run the rule based on the [type of PagerDuty event](/main/docs/incidents). Trigger, Acknowledge, Resolve, Assign, Escalate, [Custom](/main/docs/custom-incident-actions) or [Delegate](/main/docs/reassigning-and-delegating-incidents). |
| Incident Title | Run the rule based on whether the PagerDuty incident Title matches a predefined string. |
| Incident Status | Run the rule based on the [PagerDuty incident’s status](/main/docs/incidents). Triggered, Acknowledged or Resolved. |
| PagerDuty Service | Run the rule based on events generated by a [selected PagerDuty service](/main/docs/services-and-integrations). |
| PagerDuty Service Name | Run the rule based on events generated by a PagerDuty service name that matches a predefined string. |
| PagerDuty Escalation Policy | Run the rule based on incidents assigned with a [selected PagerDuty escalation policy](/main/docs/escalation-policies). |
| PagerDuty Escalation Policy Name | Run the rule based incidents assigned with a PagerDuty escalation policy name that matches a predefined string. |
| PagerDuty Incident Priority | Run the rule based on the selected [incident priority](/main/docs/incident-priority). |
| Urgency | Run the rule based on the selected [incident urgency](/main/docs/dynamic-notifications). |

The available **Salesforce Fields** vary by object label and account configuration. Please search for your object’s fields in [Salesforce’s documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/home) for more details.

22. Next, select an **Operator** and enter a value to complete the condition. You may choose to add multiple conditions for each rule. Once you are done adding your conditions, proceed to the next step.
23. Select when the following actions should be executed after the conditions are met:

* **New PagerDuty Incidents and Salesforce Objects created by this ruleset** will only execute the actions when a new object is created in PagerDuty or in Salesforce.
* **All linked PagerDuty Incidents and Salesforce objects that match the conditions specified above** will execute the actions on new and existing linked objects in PagerDuty or in Salesforce.

24. Now click **Add Action** and select a **PagerDuty Action** or **Salesforce Action**. You may choose multiple actions to be triggered from each rule.

| PagerDuty Actions | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Create new Incident, if there are no linked incidents | If rule conditions are met, create a PagerDuty [incident](/main/docs/incidents). |
| Create new Incident, if there are no linked incidents Set PagerDuty Incident Title | If rule conditions are met, a PagerDuty incident will be created with a custom, preconfigured title. To create a custom incident title: - Select the PagerDuty Action **Create new Incident, if there are no linked incidents**. - Click the **Set PagerDuty Incident Title** dropdown and select **Use Custom Incident Title**. - You can add preliminary custom text as the prefix and select up to three Salesforce case fields to construct the custom incident title. - Use the Preview bar to see how the title will look. Incident titles longer than 1024 characters will be truncated when the incident is created. |
| Acknowledge Incident | If rule conditions are met, [acknowledge](/main/docs/incidents#incident-states) the PagerDuty incident. |
| Resolve Incident | If rule conditions are met, [resolve](/main/docs/incidents#incident-states) the PagerDuty incident. |
| Set Incident Priority | If rule conditions are met, set the PagerDuty incident’s [priority](/main/docs/incident-priority) to a specified value. |
| Set Incident Urgency | If rule conditions are met, set the PagerDuty incident’s [urgency](/main/docs/service-settings#enable-urgencies) to a specified value. |
| Run Response Play | If rule conditions are met, run a specified [response play](/main/docs/response-automation) on the incident. |
| Run an Incident Workflow | If rule conditions are met, run a specified [Incident Workflow](/main/docs/incident-workflows) on the incident. |
| Run Automation Action | If rule conditions are met, run a specified [Automation Action](/main/docs/automation-actions) on the incident. |
| Reassign | If rule conditions are met, [reassign](/main/docs/reassigning-and-delegating-incidents) the PagerDuty incident. |
| Add Responders | If rule conditions are met, [add responders](/main/docs/add-responders) to the PagerDuty incident. |


| Salesforce Actions | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Set [SALESFORCE-OBJECT] field value | If rule conditions are met, set an object’s specified field value. |
| Create new [SALESFORCE-OBJECT] | If rule conditions are met, create a new specified object. |
| Set Incident Conference | If rule conditions are met, set the value of the PagerDuty conference bridge to the value of the selected Salesforce URL field. To update the PagerDuty Incident Conference field every time the salesforce field is updated, add a condition with the linked Salesforce field and the “changes” operator. |
| Set Incident Description | If rule conditions are met, set the value of the PagerDuty incident description to the value of the selected Salesforce test field. To update the PagerDuty Incident Description field every time the Salesforce field is updated, add a condition with the linked salesforce field and the “changes” operator. |

25. Click **Save** to complete the rule configuration. Navigate back to the **RULESETS** tab and click the toggle switch next to your ruleset to **Enabled**.

How can I use this application to set up 24/7 after-hours support for high priority cases or premium customers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. First, [create a PagerDuty service](/main/docs/services-and-integrations#create-a-new-service) for your Support team and create an an [on-call rotation](/main/docs/schedules#create-a-schedule) that will determine which service agents will be alerted when an urgent issue arises.
2. Next, [create a ruleset](/main/docs/salesforce-service-cloud-integration-guide#configure-rulesets) that creates an incident on this service whenever a new Salesforce case is created that meets your qualifying criteria (e.g., a high priority Salesforce Service Cloud case outside of business hours).
3. Trigger a case that meets the qualifying criteria in your ruleset to confirm that the ruleset is working as expected.

Example 24/7 After-Hours Support Ruleset




How can I create new cases in Salesforce Service Cloud based on the content of a PagerDuty incident?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a rule **On PagerDuty Update** instead of [Object] Create/Update, specify what conditions to look for on a PagerDuty update, and what you would like Salesforce Service Cloud to do when it meets that criteria. Make sure you also use **Set [SALESFORCE-OBJECT]** field value for ALL required fields in your Salesforce Service Cloud object.

For example, if you want to automatically create a Salesforce Service Cloud Case object when a PagerDuty incident is created on Service “XYZ”, you would have a Ruleset that looks like the following:

![Example ruleset for creating new cases in Salesforce Service Cloud based on the content of a PagerDuty incident](https://files.readme.io/073f53b-salesforcev3-faq-ruleset-example.png "salesforcev3-faq-ruleset-example.png")



Example ruleset for creating new cases in Salesforce Service Cloud based on the content of a PagerDuty incident




Can I use PagerDuty Rulesets with other Salesforce records besides Cases and Incidents?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Please follow these steps to allow PagerDuty rulesets to interact with other Salesforce records:

1. In Salesforce Service Cloud, click the **cog icon**  select **Setup**  click **Objects and Fields** in the left hand menu  select **Object Manager**.
2. Click the **Label name** of the object on which you would like to create a trigger and click **Triggers** in the left hand menu. Click **New** on the right side of the screen.
3. Enter the following text as a trigger body, replacing [SALESFORCE-OBJECT] with your Salesforce Service Cloud object:

```
trigger PagerDuty[SALESFORCE-OBJECT]Trigger on [SALESFORCE-OBJECT] (after insert, after update) {
    if (!System.isFuture() && !System.isBatch()) {
        String oldStr = JSON.serialize(Trigger.oldMap);
        String newStr = JSON.serialize(Trigger.newMap);
        if (!Test.isRunningTest()) pagerdutyinc.PagerDutyEngineLauncher.launchByTrigger(oldStr, newStr, Trigger.isInsert);
    }
}

```

**Example**:

```
trigger PagerDutyOpportunityTrigger on Opportunity (after insert, after update) {
    if (!System.isFuture() && !System.isBatch()) {
        String oldStr = JSON.serialize(Trigger.oldMap);
        String newStr = JSON.serialize(Trigger.newMap);
        if (!Test.isRunningTest()) pagerdutyinc.PagerDutyEngineLauncher.launchByTrigger(oldStr, newStr, Trigger.isInsert);
    }
}

```

4. Click **Save**. Repeat these steps for each object on which you would like to create a trigger.

Why don’t I see any data on my Status Dashboard?
------------------------------------------------

If you don’t see any data on your Status Dashboard, please confirm that you have a one [configured in PagerDuty](/main/docs/status-dashboard#configure-status-dashboard). To check, navigate to `https://[your PagerDuty subdomain].pagerduty.com/status-dashboard`.

What kind of custom permissions do users need to use this integration?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use custom permissions in Salesforce, you will need to ensure that agents have the correct permissions to use and access the PagerDuty integration. There are four permission sets included in the managed package that can be given to users.

| PagerDutyAdministrator | PagerDutyConfiguration | readwrite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PagerDutyIncident Mapping | readcreateeditdelete |
| PagerDutyRules & Rulesets | readcreateeditdelete |
| PagerDutyConfiguration Tab | on |
| PagerDutyAuditor | PagerDutyConfiguration | read |
| PagerDutyIncident Mapping | read |
| PagerDutyRules & Rulesets | read |
| PagerDutyConfiguration Tab | on |
| PagerDutyManager | PagerDutyConfiguration | read |
| PagerDutyIncident Mapping | readcreateeditdelete |
| PagerDutyRules & Rulesets | readcreateeditdelete |
| PagerDutyConfiguration Tab | on |
| PagerDutyUser | PagerDutyConfiguration | read |
| PagerDutyIncident Mapping | readcreateedit |
| PagerDutyRules & Rulesets | read |
| PagerDutyConfiguration Tab | off |


If you do not want to add permission sets to your users, you may check their profiles and ensure the profiles have similar object permissions for their user type.

How can I troubleshoot issues during login to the PagerDuty console?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Check to make sure all users have valid permissions.
* Check to make sure the redirect URL is set correctly in PagerDuty.
* Check to make sure that the OAuth app has read/write privileges and not just read privileges.

How can I troubleshoot my integration?
