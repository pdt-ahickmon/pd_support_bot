Slack Integration Guide | PagerDuty
===================================

Slack + PagerDuty Integration Benefits
======================================

* Collaborate seamlessly while managing PagerDuty incidents end-to-end from [incident dedicated channels](/main/docs/slack-user-guide#dedicated-channel).
* Increase awareness of active incidents by receiving notifications in Slack, either by pre-configured [service/team channel connections](/main/docs/slack-integration-guide#add-a-slack-channel-connection), or incident [notification channels](/main/docs/slack-user-guide#notification-channel).
* Look up who is on-call, create Insights reports and manage the integration.
* [Take action](/main/docs/slack-user-guide#available-actions) on your incident, all without leaving Slack.
  + Trigger, acknowledge, escalate and resolve PagerDuty incidents.
  + Run Incident Workflows, send status updates, assign roles and delegate tasks.
* Save time by leveraging [PagerDuty Advance GenAI](/main/docs/pagerduty-advance#pagerduty-advance--chat-apps-benefits) capabilities.
  + Efficiently getting context (ex. `@PagerDuty what changed?`).
  + Generating status updates (ex. `@PagerDuty draft a status update`).
  + Summarizing the incident after resolution for post-incident reviews.
* Easily build post-incident reviews in [Jeli](/main/docs/get-started-with-jeli) by importing Slack data for analysis.

Requirements
============

**In PagerDuty**:

* **Initial Configuration**: This integration requires an Admin, Global Admin or Account Owner base role to perform the [initial configuration](#initial-configuration). This includes mapping your PagerDuty account to your Slack workspace.
* **Slack Connection Management**: Once your PagerDuty account has been mapped to your Slack workspace (see above) Team Managers, Admins and Account Owners can [add a Slack channel connection](#add-a-slack-channel-connection) to a PagerDuty service.
* **Using the Integration**: In order to use the [Slack slash command](/main/docs/slack-user-guide#available-slash-commands) `/pd trigger` to trigger a PagerDuty incident, you must have a PagerDuty user license. In other words, all Slack users who have mapped their Slack and PagerDuty accounts can trigger incidents from the Slack interface. Other actions, such as acknowledging, resolving, viewing incident details, adding a note, escalating or running an Incident Workflow follow the PagerDuty [user permissions](/main/docs/advanced-permissions) for each action.
  + If some employees in your organization do not have PagerDuty licenses, but you would like them to be able to trigger PagerDuty incidents, you can [create an incident trigger Slack workflow](/main/docs/slack-user-guide#create-an-incident-trigger-slack-workflow) to enable this action.
* The Slack integration is supported for both US and EU service regions.

**In Slack**:

* To install the PagerDuty application, you need to be a workspace admin or owner.

How it Works
============

* You can create [dedicated channels](/main/docs/slack-user-guide#dedicated-channel) to centralize incident coordination in Slack, and link [notification channels](/main/docs/slack-user-guide#notification-channel) for awareness of incidents in progress.
* You can trigger, acknowledge, resolve, and perform [other actions](/main/docs/slack-user-guide#available-actions) within Slack.
* If you configure a [service/team channel connection](/main/docs/slack-integration-guide#add-a-slack-channel-connection), upon incident trigger, an incident card will automatically send to the designated channel for all incidents for the configured service or team. Users can then perform actions (listed above) within Slack, or within PagerDuty, and the actions will be synced bi-directionally.

Please see the [PagerDuty Privacy Policy](https://www.pagerduty.com/privacy-policy/) to read more about how we collect, use and disclose your information.

Integration Walkthrough
=======================

Initial Configuration
---------------------

1. First, you will map your PagerDuty account to your Slack Workspace. In PagerDuty, navigate to **Integrations**  **Extensions**. Select the **Slack** tile at the top.
   * If prompted, click **Authorize Integration**.
2. On the Slack Workspaces mapping screen, click **Connect a new Workspace** to connect your PagerDuty account to your Slack workspace. Connecting your PagerDuty account to your Slack workspace ensures that the PagerDuty bot is present and that PagerDuty slash commands can be executed from any Slack channel.
3. On the next screen, you will be asked to authorize the PagerDuty for Slack integration.
4. Click **Allow** to authorize.
5. On the next screen, you have the option to enable or disable the following settings by toggling them to the **on** or **off** position:
   * **Stop incident updates and actions upon team reassignment**:
     + **On**: When an incident is reassigned to another team, updates and actions for that incident will be disabled in your channel and enabled in the other team's channel.
     + **Off**: When an incident is reassigned to another team, updates and actions for that incident will continue to be available in your channel, and they will also be enabled in the other team's channel.
   * **Create a Slack thread for all incidents**:
     + **On**: After the initial trigger notification, all further incident notifications will be posted in a thread under the trigger notification.
     + **Off**: All incident notifications will be posted in the main Slack channel.

Once this step is complete, you can then begin connecting PagerDuty services or teams to a specific Slack channel, and using PagerDuty to manage incidents in Slack.

Add a Slack Channel Connection
------------------------------

> 🚧 Required User Permissions
> ---------------------------
> 
> You will only be able to add connections to channels that you have Slack permissions for. If you do not have the appropriate Slack permissions for a channel, it will not appear in search results. If you need permissions to access a Slack channel, please contact your Slack administrator.

> 📘 Private Slack Channels
> ------------------------
> 
> If you add a connection to a *private* Slack channel, the PagerDuty app (**@pagerduty**) will be automatically added to the channel. If the PagerDuty app is thereafter manually removed from that channel, it will cause the automatic deletion of the connection between the PagerDuty service or team and that Slack channel, and no subsequent incident notifications will be received in the channel.

Finally, you will add Slack channel connection(s). There are two ways to add channel connections:

* [Via Slack Connection Management Page](#via-slack-connection-management-page)
* [Via Slack Command](#via-slack-command)

### Via Slack Connection Management Page

On the Slack Connection Management page (**Integrations**  **Slack Integration**  click **View** next to your preferred Workspace), click **Add Connection**. Make selections in the following fields based on your preference:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PagerDuty Source | Select your preferred PagerDuty source: - **Service**: Slack notifications will come from an individual service. - **Team**: Slack notifications will come from all services associated with the selected Team.**Note**: If you add a connection to a service and then add a connection to a Team associated with the same service, you will receive double notifications for that service. We recommend checking for duplicates when adding Team connections. |
| Slack channel | Search and select your preferred **channel** or paste your preferred channel's **ID**. You must enter at least 3 characters in order to return search results. |
| Notification type | Select the radio button for your preferred notification type: - **Responder**: Notifications include buttons for users to acknowledge, resolve, and take [other actions](#incident-actions) on incidents. - **Stakeholder**: Notifications do not include any buttons to take action on incidents. |
| Notify the channel of these updates: | You may check or uncheck the following update types: - Acknowledged - Unacknowledged - Escalated - Resolved - Reassigned - Note added - Delegated - Priority changed - Reopened - Responder requested - Responder joined / declined - Status update added |
| When the incident matches these criteria: | - **Urgency**: Select your preferred urgency. - **Priority**: Select your preferred priority. |

Click **Add Connection** to connect your PagerDuty source to your Slack channel. To add multiple channel connections, repeat steps 4-5 as many times as needed. Once you have finished adding your connections, the Slack integration is now complete.

![Add connection](https://files.readme.io/9b4f908-slack-connection-management.png "Add connection")



Add connection



### Via Slack Command

Navigate to your preferred **Slack channel**, enter the `/pd connect` command and make selections in the following fields based on your preferences:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Choose a PagerDuty account | Select your **PagerDuty account** from the dropdown. |
| Connect service or team to `[CHANNEL-NAME]` | Search and select the **service** or **team** that you would like to connect to the channel. |
| How do you want to be notified? | Select the radio button for your preferred notification type: - **Responder**: Notifications include buttons for users to acknowledge, resolve, and take [other actions](#incident-actions) on incidents. - **Stakeholder**: Notifications do not include any buttons to take action on incidents. |

Click **Connect** to connect your PagerDuty source to your Slack channel. To add multiple channel connections, repeat steps 4-5 as many times as needed. Once you have finished adding your connections, the Slack integration is now complete.

> 👍 Slack User Guide
> ------------------
> 
> Once initial configuration is complete, please read our [Slack User Guide](/main/docs/slack-user-guide) for instructions on how to use the integration.

Granular Bot Permissions
========================

The Slack integration uses granular bot permissions, as detailed in the [Bot Token Scopes](#bot-token-scopes) table. All channel connections will be affected by granular bot permissions, but new connections will closely follow Slack workspace security settings. Creating channel connections may require users to have additional Slack permissions or admin authorization, as detailed in the [Approve App Update](#approve-app-update) section below.

Approve App Update
------------------

There are two Slack settings that may impact the app update:

* App Updates require a Slack Admin approval.
* Only Slack Admins or Slack app Managers can create PagerDuty service to Slack channel connections.

If a user does not have the correct Slack user permissions, then a notification will be sent to a Slack admin to approve the connection. If a Slack admin does not approve the new changes, users will not be able to create new Slack channels and PagerDuty service connections. If your Slack account has not restricted these settings, no action is required.

To approve the app update as a Slack Admin:

1. Navigate to the Slack admin portal and search for the PagerDuty app.
2. At the top right of the page, click **Approve** next to **Manage app for entire workspace?** and approve PagerDuty app changes.

Bot Token Scopes
----------------

| OAuth Scope | Slack Description | PagerDuty Request Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app_mentions:read` | View messages that directly mention `@pagerduty` in conversations that the app is in. | Used for interactions with PagerDuty bot and responding to commands. |
| `bookmarks:write` | Create, edit, and remove bookmarks | Used to automate the creation of bookmarks within an incident dedicated channel. |
| `channels:join` | Join public channels in a workspace. | After a public channel has been created, we will use this scope to join the channel. |
| `channels:manage` | Manage public channels that PagerDuty has been added to and create new ones. | This will allow us to create public channels. |

Optional Scopes
---------------

There are two sets of optional scopes you may enable or disable, depending on which PagerDuty platform features you intend to use. These scopes are required to leverage [PagerDuty Advance](/main/docs/pagerduty-advance) in Slack, or to ingest data into [Jeli](/main/docs/get-started-with-jeli) for post-incident analysis.

> ❗️ Slack Workspace Admin/Owner Required
> ---------------------------------------
> 
> Similar to initial setup of PagerDuty into your Slack workspace, **a Slack admin is required** to Enable or Disable optional scopes.
> 
> When Disabling scopes, you must complete the Slack OAuth flow to avoid interruption of service in the PagerDuty Slack app. To remove the optional scopes, PagerDuty will be briefly uninstalled from your workspace, then reinstalled with the more limited set of scopes.

![Enable or Disable optional scopes from the Slack configuration page.](https://files.readme.io/6edcf3f7df26a7a24f82d9d43926ff3882dec49fb9f93ea7ae98fc499944ebf7-slack-optional-scopes-highlighted.png)



Enable or Disable optional scopes from the Slack configuration page.



### Chat Message Ingestion

By enabling `Chat message ingestion` on the Slack configuration page, we will request three additional scopes:

| OAuth Scope | Slack Description | PagerDuty Request Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `channels:history` | View messages and other content in public channels that the PagerDuty app has been added to. | Used to ingest Slack messages into PagerDuty for use as evidence in post-incident reviews and to summarize what happened during an incident. |
| `reactions:read` | View emoji reactions in channels and conversations that the PagerDuty app has been added to. | Used to display emoji reactions when ingesting Slack messages as evidence for post-incident reviews. |
| `reactions:write` | Add and edit emoji reactions. | When users make certain requests to the PagerDuty Slack app, we respond with an emoji to indicate we have received the request. |

### Private Channel Ingestion

By enabling `Private channel ingestion` on the Slack configuration page, we will request one additional scope:

| OAuth Scope | Slack Description | PagerDuty Request Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `groups:history` | View messages and other content in private channels that the PagerDuty app has been added to. | Used to ingest Slack messages from private channels into PagerDuty for use as evidence in post-incident reviews and to summarize what happened during an incident. |

Reauthorization
===============

You may need to reauthorize your Slack scopes in order to gain access to new features.

To reauthorize, PagerDuty admins should visit **Integrations**  **Extensions**  **Slack Integration**. If reauthorization is required, you will see **Reauthorize** next to the name of your Slack workspace.

![Reauthorize](https://files.readme.io/2c47f537ac4189873762596a5140da9a7552a0c7399e1f976b6fedd369cd7897-slack-config.png "Reauthorize")



Reauthorize



After clicking **Reauthorize** you will be asked to approve the additional scopes and permissions needed for new functionality. Reauthorization will not impact your current functionality or integration configuration.

Add Multiple Slack Workspace to PagerDuty Connections
=====================================================

In this version of the integration, you may add multiple workspace connections to multiple PagerDuty accounts.

Follow the [Integration Walkthrough instructions](/main/docs/slack-integration-guide#integration-walkthrough) for as many workspaces as you need to add to each PagerDuty account.

Slack Connection Management
===========================

Users with a Manager, Admin or Account Owner role can manage connections in PagerDuty on the **Slack Connection Management** page under **Integrations**  **Extensions**  **Slack Integration** . **Note**: This version of the Slack integration is no longer managed at the service level.

FAQ
===

Expand/Collapse All

Why is workspace mapping required?
----------------------------------

Workspace mapping connects a PagerDuty account to a Slack workspace. This provides authorization and access to all channels in a workspace and removes the need to authorize connections on a channel by channel, service by service basis.

Can Managers perform the initial setup of a channel/service connection, or access and edit the settings for a connection?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Users with a Manager role or higher can create and [manage their teams’ connections](#slack-connection-management).
* A PagerDuty users with an Admin role or higher will still need to [connect the PagerDuty account to the Slack Workspace](#initial-configuration) first.

Is there a way to allow non-PagerDuty users to trigger incidents in Slack?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers can trigger an incident without a PagerDuty license. Please see the section [Create an Incident Trigger Slack Workflow](/main/docs/slack-user-guide#create-an-incident-trigger-slack-workflow) for more information.

I changed my channel from public to private, and now my incidents aren't posting to Slack.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please invite the PagerDuty bot (`@PagerDuty` ) to your Slack channel after you set it to private.

Do I need to install anything else to use slash commands?
---------------------------------------------------------

No, slash commands are available out-of-the-box. In order use the `/pd trigger` command, please make sure that you’ve mapped Slack workspace PagerDuty (step 4 of the [Integration Walkthrough](#integration-walkthrough)). **Note**: Users must have a PagerDuty license and be signed in to use `/pd trigger`.

Can I add multiple Slack workspaces to a single PagerDuty account?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can map multiple workspaces to a single PagerDuty account by repeating the [Initial Configuration](#initial-configuration).

Can I connect a workspace to both a PagerDuty account in the US service region and a PagerDuty account in the EU service region?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can map a single workspace to PagerDuty accounts in different regions. You'll just need to make sure to run [slash commands](/main/docs/slack-user-guide#available-slash-commands) with the appropriate prefix (`/pd` for US and `/pdeu` for EU).

How do I view on-call information in Slack?
-------------------------------------------

Use the command `/pd oncall` to see who is on call.
