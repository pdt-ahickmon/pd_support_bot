Event Orchestration
===================

Event Orchestration allows users to route events to an endpoint and create nested rules, which define sets of actions to take based on event content. Event Orchestration is PagerDuty’s modern solution to help tackle your existing and future automation goals.

> 🚧 Required User Permissions
> ---------------------------
> 
> The following user roles can create/edit/delete Event Orchestrations:
> 
> * User
> * Admin
> * Manager base roles and team roles. Manager team roles can create/edit/delete Event Orchestrations associated with their team.
> * Global Admin
> * Account Owner

Configure Event Orchestration
=============================

Step 1: Create an Orchestration
-------------------------------

There are three ways to create an Orchestration:

* [Global Orchestrations](/main/docs/event-orchestration#global-orchestrations) (Available with [PagerDuty AIOps](/main/docs/aiops) only)
* [Global Integrations](#global-integrations) (Available on all packages)
* [Service Orchestrations](/main/docs/event-orchestration#service-orchestrations) (Available on all packages)

### Global Orchestrations

When an incoming event stream has more than one service destination, you can use Global Orchestrations to apply common event actions and route events to different services.

> 📘 Availability
> --------------
> 
> Global Orchestrations are only available on accounts with the [PagerDuty AIOps](/main/docs/aiops) add-on and the [Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration) pricing tier.

To create a new Global Orchestration:

1. Navigate to **AIOps**  **Event Orchestration** and select **+ New Orchestration**.
2. Enter an **Orchestration Name** and an optional **Orchestration Description**.
3. Click **Save**.
4. On the next screen, select **Integrations** to view the **Integration Key**, **Email Address** (for email integrations) and **HTTP Endpoint for API** that you can use to connect your alerting systems with PagerDuty. Please follow your alerting system’s [integration guide](https://www.pagerduty.com/integrations/) for configuration instructions.
5. Select **Global Orchestration** to navigate to the Global Orchestration Rules graph.
6. Click **New Rule** to create a new rule. Continue to [Step 2: Create Rules](/main/docs/event-orchestration#step-2-create-rules).

### Global Integrations

When an incoming event stream has more than one service destination, you can use Global Integrations to route events to different services and apply Service Orchestration rule actions.

> 📘 Availability
> --------------
> 
> Global Integrations are available on all packages.

1. Navigate to **AIOps**  **Event Orchestration** and select **+ New Orchestration**.
2. Enter an **Orchestration Name** and an optional **Orchestration Description**.
3. Click **Save**.
4. On the next screen, select **Integrations** to view the **Integration Key**, **Email Address** (for email integrations) and **HTTP Endpoint for API** that you can use to connect your alerting systems with PagerDuty. Please follow your alerting system’s [integration guide](https://www.pagerduty.com/integrations/) for configuration instructions.
5. Next, select the **Service Routes** tab. Continue to [Step 2: Create Rules](/main/docs/event-orchestration#step-2-create-rules).

### Service Orchestrations

When integrations exist on a service, you can use Service Orchestrations to evaluate your incoming events and perform additional actions.

> 📘 Availability
> --------------
> 
> Service Orchestrations are available on all packages.
> 
> If you have a service that uses [Service Event Rules](/main/docs/rulesets#service-event-rules), you can switch to Service Orchestrations at any time. Please read the section [Switch to Service Orchestrations](#switch-to-service-orchestrations) for more information.

To create a new Service Orchestration:

1. Navigate to **Services**  **Service Directory**  click your desired **service name** and select the **Settings** tab.
2. Scroll to **Event Management** and click **Service Orchestration Rules**.
3. Click **+ New Rule** and continue to [Step 2: Create Rules](/main/docs/event-orchestration#step-2-create-rules).

#### Create a Service Orchestration from a Global Integration or Orchestration

A Service Orchestration can also be created after a Global Integration, or Global Orchestration is made. This method allows users to create the rules that define what happens after events are routed to a service.

To create a new Service Orchestration from a Global Integration or Orchestration:

1. Navigate to **AIOps**  **Event Orchestration**  select your desired **Orchestration** and then click **Service Orchestrations**.
2. Select a **service** from the **Service Event Rules** dropdown.
3. You will then be taken to the Service Orchestration graph for the service you selected. Continue to [Step 2: Create Rules](/main/docs/event-orchestration#step-2-create-rules).

Step 2: Create Rules
--------------------

With Event Orchestration there are three distinct types of rules that a user can create:

* [Global Orchestration Rules](#global-and-service-orchestration-rules) (Available with [PagerDuty AIOps](/main/docs/aiops) only): Global Orchestration rules are optional rules that can be created *before* a routing rule. They determine which actions are applied to events during event processing as well as how events eventually turn into incidents. Actions applied at the Global Orchestration rule level will apply to ***all*** events that match the rule’s conditions, regardless of which service they are eventually routed to. Any actions applied can be overridden by Service Orchestration rules which also match against a given event. The last evaluated rule will take precedence where a single enrichment, alert, or incident action is taken multiple times.
* [Routing Rules](/main/docs/event-orchestration#routing-rules) (Available on all packages): Routing rules define how events are routed to services. They must be created in order for events to be routed from a Global Integration or Orchestration to a service.
* [Service Orchestration Rules](#global-and-service-orchestration-rules) (Available on all packages): Service Orchestration rules are optional rules that can be created after a routing rule. They determine which actions are applied to events during processing, and how events eventually turn into incidents. Service Orchestration rules will have their own conditions and will be linked to rules that precede and follow them.

### Recommended Preparation

We recommend sending events to your Orchestration integration key in order to inspect the incoming JSON key/value pairs and build rules from there.

To send events to Orchestrations:

1. Navigate to **AIOps**​​  **Event Orchestration**, select your preferred **Orchestration** and click **Integrations**.
2. On the following screen, select the integration key set you want to work with and copy the appropriate **Integration Key** to use in your upstream event source, e.g., a monitoring tool or CI pipeline.

**Note**: An Orchestration can have up to 10 integration keys associated with it. Using any of these integration keys will direct events toward the Orchestration rules and routing rules specified for the Orchestration.

### Routing Rules

In order for Event Orchestration to route events to the appropriate service, you will need to create routing rules. Some things to keep in mind while working with your routing rules:

* There can only be one routing rule per service per Event Orchestration. For example, if **Orchestration A** routes events to **Service A**, you cannot configure another rule within the same orchestration to route to the same service, however you *could* configure **Orchestration B** to route events to **Service A**.
* Routing rule conditions can be based on either [PD-CEF](/main/docs/pd-cef)-transformed event data or raw event payloads.
* You can also create Dynamic Routing Rules, which evaluate *all* events and do not have conditions. Dynamic Routing Rules are able to route events to services based on the **Service name** or **Service ID** in the payload. Dynamic Routing Rules are evaluated before any other routing rules on a service router.
* Events that do not match any configured rules will match to the [catch all rule](#catch-all-rule) . The default catch all behavior does not send these events to a specific service & never creates an incident. You can edit the catch all rule to send these events to a specific service instead.

#### Create a Dynamic Routing Rule

To create a dynamic routing rule:

1. Navigate to **AIOps**  **Event Orchestration** and select your preferred **Orchestration**.
2. Click **Service Routes**  **New Dynamic Route**.

![A screenshot of the PagerDuty UI emphasizing the "New Dynamic Route" button](https://files.readme.io/6bdab25-new_dynamic_route.png)



Select New Dynamic Route



3. In the modal, select the **Event Field** where routing information (i.e., either service name or service ID) is located. You can select any single [PD-CEF](/main/docs/pd-cef) field. For example, `event.summary` refers to the Summary field. You may also select free text field formats: **Raw Event** (e.g., `raw_event.foo.bar`) or **Custom Details** (e.g., `event.custom_details.foo.bar`).
4. In the **Format** dropdown, select **Service name** (default) or **Service ID**. This setting specifies if the Dynamic Routing Rule should attempt to match events to services via its name or ID (e.g., `PXXXXXX`).
5. In the **Extraction Regex** field, enter an [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) regex pattern that identifies where service information is located in the selected field. If you specify a capture group, the part matched by the capture group will be used to set the variable. Otherwise, the entire match will be used.
6. Click **Save**.

> 📘 Dynamic Routing Rules
> -----------------------
> 
> Please keep the following information in mind while configuring a dynamic routing rule:
> 
> * If an event does not match to a service based your dynamic routing rule configuration, it will evaluate against the next [routing rule](#create-a-routing-rule) in the service's router.
> * If an event contains malformed information in the field targeted for dynamic routing, Event Orchestration will drop the event (e.g., if you have configure a dynamic routing rule based on service ID, but the specified field does not contain data shaped like a service ID).
> * [Global Orchestrations](#global-orchestrations) execute before Dynamic Routing Rules. Manipulating a CEF field in a Global Orchestration may lead to unintended behavior if a downstream Dynamic Routing Rule reads from that field.
> * Service names are stored as cached data for routing purposes. It can take up to 10 minutes for the service name cache to update after a service’s name has been changed. During this time events will continue to match to services based on the previously configured service names.

#### Create a Routing Rule

To create a routing rule:

1. Navigate to **AIOps**  **Event Orchestration**  select your preferred **Orchestration**  **Service Routes**  click **New Service Route**.
   * *Optional*: next to , enter a **description** for your new rule.
2. From the dropdown **What service should events route to?**, select a service you’d like to route events to.
3. Under **When should events be routed here?**, select one of the following options:
   * **Always (for all events)**
   * **If events match certain conditions**
   * **On a recurring weekly schedule** (Available with [Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration))
   * **During a scheduled date range** (Available with [Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration))
   * **Depends on event frequency** (Available with [Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration))
4. Depending on your selection in the previous step, configure the rule according to your needs.
5. Click **Save**.

#### Catch All Rule

If an event does not match any configured routing rules, it will perform the action outlined by the **catch all rule**. There are two options available for this rule:

* **Events not matching a previous rule should not be sent to a specific service & should never create an incident (Default)**: If a **trigger** event reaches this rule, it will create a suppressed alert. If a **resolve** event reaches this rule, the rule will attempt to resolve an open alert previously created through the orchestration with the same `dedup_key`, regardless of service. These events can also resolve suppressed alerts if a matching `dedup_key` exists.
* **Send all events not matching a previous rule to a service**: If an event reaches this rule, it will be routed to the chosen service and can be evaluated further by the service’s Service Orchestration if one exists.

> 👍 Event Orchestration Examples
> ------------------------------
> 
> Please see [Event Orchestration Examples](/main/docs/event-orchestration-examples) for more details on both common and advanced routing rule configurations.

Global and Service Orchestration Rules
--------------------------------------

* Global Orchestration rules are optional rules that can be created *before* a routing rule. These rules will have their own conditions and will be linked to rules that precede and follow them.
* Global Orchestration rules can include any action except those that define how an event is routed to a service.
* Service Orchestration rules are optional rules that can be created *after* a routing rule. These rules will have their own conditions and will be linked to rules that precede and follow them.
* Service Orchestration rules determine which actions are applied to events during processing before an incident triggers.
* When there is more than one potential global or service orchestration rule that an event could match against, that group of rules is called a **set**. Events will match against whichever rule in a set has the highest ordinality (i.e., appears first, either in the UI or API).
* When creating a Global or Service Orchestration rule, any conditions can be created and combined, similar to a routing rule, however, threshold-based conditions can only ever exist on their own. If a user wants to create a rule with a threshold-based condition they must make a specific service rule that only has that condition present.

> 📘 Ruleset Limits
> ----------------
> 
> A set of rules grouped vertically in the web app can be referred to as a "ruleset." Rulesets can have up to 25 rules. As needed, you can [nest rules](#configure-a-global-or-service-orchestration-rule), which will allow you to create more than 25 rules in an orchestration, however we advise against making orchestrations too complex, as this can make it difficult to maintain, or for other teams to understand your orchestration's logic.

Configure a Global or Service Orchestration Rule
------------------------------------------------

1. Navigate to **AIOps**  **Event Orchestration**  select your preferred **Orchestration**  select **Global Orchestration** or **Service Orchestrations** (and select a service), and click **New Rule** on an empty Orchestration rule page or  on an Orchestration rule page with existing rules.
2. A modal will appear on the page. Select the type of condition, then specify the appropriate **conditions** for this new rule.
3. Click **Next**.
4. Specify the **actions** that should be applied in the following menus:

* [Incident Data](#incident-data)
  + [Basic Event](#basic-event)
  + [Event Fields](#event-fields)
  + [Custom Fields](#custom-fields)
* [Rule Variables](#create-custom-rule-variables)
* [Alert Data](#alert-data)
* [Automation](#automation)
  + [Webhooks](/main/docs/event-orchestration#webhooks)
  + [Automation Actions](/main/docs/event-orchestration#automation-actions)

5. Click **Save** to save this new rule.

### Incident Data

#### Basic Event

Determine how the incident should be created, or override default incident creation.

| Incident Action Option | Instructions and Details |
| --- | --- |
| Create an alert but pause notifications ([Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration)) | An incident can trigger after a predetermined amount of time. Enter the **amount of time** you would like to pass before an incident and notifications are created in the **Suspend alert for \_ second(s) before triggering incident** field. See [Pause Incident Notifications](#pause-incident-notifications) for more details. |
| Suppress alert ([Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration)) | Alerts that match the routing rule conditions will suppress, meaning they will not create PagerDuty incidents or notify responders. You may want to suppress alerts if you don't want responders to be notified outside of support hours, or within any specific [timeframe](/main/docs/event-orchestration#create-a-routing-rule). Suppressed alerts are visible in the [Alerts table](/main/docs/alerts#alerts-table). |
| Drop incident and stop processing ([Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration)) | **Note**: Only available for Global Orchestration rules. Events that match this rule will be dropped out of PagerDuty’s event ingestion pipeline. They will generate no data within the PagerDuty platform, will not create Incidents, and will not be turned into Alerts. It is not possible to audit PagerDuty for events that were dropped. |
| Set Priority | To set priority, check the **Set Priority** checkbox and select your desired **priority level** from the dropdown.[Incident priority](/main/docs/incident-priority) allows the classification of incidents based on a level of prioritization. Incident priority must be [enabled on your account](/main/docs/incident-priority#section-enabling-incident-priority) before it can be set with orchestrations. |
| Dynamic Escalation Policy Override | To override a service's assigned [Escalation Policy](/main/docs/escalation-policies) , select your preferred escalation policy from the dropdown. The on call responder associated with the selected escalation policy will receive notifications when an incident triggers, instead of the responder associated with the service's configured escalation policy. |
| Add a note to the incident | To add a note when an incident is created, under **Additional Context**, enter the text of the note that you would like to be added to an incident that meets your rule’s criteria. If multiple rules in an orchestration add a note, only the note from the most recently evaluated rule will be added to the incident.[Notes](/main/docs/edit-incidents#add-a-note-via-event-orchestration) can be used to help responders resolve incidents quicker by including information or links related to the system that the event comes from. |

#### Event Fields

Event Fields allow you to copy important data from any combination of source event fields into any [PagerDuty Common Event Format (CEF)](/main/docs/pd-cef) field. Translate difficult machine terms and code into helpful context for responders so they can effectively respond to the problem. Event Fields can also be used to enhance PagerDuty AIOps capabilities by customizing alerts, influencing the [Intelligent Alert Grouping](/main/docs/intelligent-alert-grouping) and Intelligent Triage machine learning algorithms.

Enrich and update any [CEF](/main/docs/pd-cef) field or even create new key values within the Custom Details object using custom rule variables. When events are sent to PagerDuty, they are transformed into Common Event Format. You can replace any CEF field or even create new key values within the Custom Details object.

> 📘 Availability

> Event Fields are available with [Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration).

![Event Orchestrations transformations](https://files.readme.io/44b289a-event_fields.png "Event Orchestrations transformations")



Event Orchestrations Event Fields



1. Click **Add Event Field**.
2. Perform the following:

| Replace Event Field | Instructions and Details |
| --- | --- |
| Common Event Field (CEF) | Select your preferred **Common Event Field (CEF)** from the **Event field to set** dropdown. |
| Right dropdown | Select whether you would like to use **Regex** *or* a **Template** from the **Replace using** dropdown. |
| Template option | If you chose a text template from the dropdown, you can reference a variable defined in the [Create Custom Rule Variables](#create-custom-rule-variables) section above using `{{ }}` brackets (e.g., `{{class}}`) in the **Replace with value** field. |
| Regex option | If you chose the **Regex** option from the dropdown, enter a **Value** and the origin **Source**. |

Event Fields are available with both Global Orchestrations and Service Orchestrations.

###### Deduplication

The `dedup_key` field is used to merge events into a single alert. Events with the same `dedup_key` can update the status of the alert they are automatically merged into.

To set a deduplication key:

1. In the Event Fields section of your rule, under Define Custom Variable, [create a rule variable](#create-custom-rule-variables) from event fields by entering a **Variable Name**, **Event Field** and the **Extraction Regex**. You may use Sample Events on the right to create these rule variables.
2. Next, select **Dedup Key** from the **Event field to set** dropdown. Select whether you would like to use **Regex** or a **Template** from the right hand dropdown. If you use a Template, you can reference a rule variable defined in step 1 using `{{variable name here}}` brackets in **Replace with value** field. If you are using Regex, enter a **Value** and the **Source**.

> 🚧 Using Event Fields on Email Events
> ------------------------------------
> 
> [Event Fields](#event-fields) are only available for email events sent to [Global Integrations](#global-integrations). Users can extract data from the email event using regex matching into multiple rule variables. **Currently, only `Summary` and `Dedup_Key` Common Event Fields can be replaced for email events.**

#### Custom Fields

Replace or fill incident Custom Fields with static text, [event fields](#event-fields) or [rule variables](#create-custom-rule-variables). This allows you to bring event data into your incidents and use event-driven automation in your incident management. For example, you may wish to pass the `component`, `class`, or other `custom details` event fields into incident custom fields. Once a value is in a custom field, it can be used elsewhere in our product such as [Status Update Templates](/main/docs/status-update-templates) or as part of our [ServiceNow integration](/main/docs/servicenow-integration-guide), which supports [custom fields bi-directional syncing](/main/docs/advanced-servicenow-configuration#custom-field-mappings).

> 📘 Availability
> --------------
> 
> * Business Plans and above are able to set Custom Fields to static text values through Event Orchestration (#3 in table below)
> * Enterprise for Incident Management, Digital Operations (Legacy), Event Intelligence or AIOps plans are able to dynamically populate custom field values with Event Orchestration. This includes replacement with both event fields and variables (#1 and #2 in table below).

> 📘 Custom Fields Set on New Incidents
> ------------------------------------
> 
> Custom fields will only be set when the event triggers a new incident. Subsequent events and alerts that are grouped or deduplicated into the incident do not update Custom Fields at this time.

![](https://files.readme.io/4ddee59-eo-custom-fields.png)

1. Click **Add Custom Incident Field**.
2. Perform the following:

| Custom field to set | Replace with value |
| --- | --- |
| Select your preferred **Custom Field** | There are a few options for how to replace values: 1. **Replace with event field**: Use double curly brackets to reference event fields. E.g.: `{{event.component}}`. 2. **Replace with [variable](/main/docs/event-orchestration#create-custom-rule-variables)**: Use double curly brackets to reference both cache variables and rule variables. **Note**: variables must first exist before they can be referenced. E.g.: `{{variables.env}} {{cache_var.foo_bar}}` 3. **Replace with static text**: Simply use static text, such as `foo-bar` in the above image. |

Please see the [Event Fields](/main/docs/event-orchestration#event-fields) section for more information.

##### Field Types Supported

| Custom Field Type | Expected Event Orchestration Format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | As is | Hello World |
| Single Select | As-is | OptionA |
| Multiple Select | Array with quoted strings | [“OptionA”, “OptionB”] |
| Tag | Array with quoted strings | [“TagA”, “TagB”] |
| Date-Time | ISO-8601 formatted date-time with timezone. Microseconds are accepted but not required. - yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sss±hh:mm - yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss±hh:mm - yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ - yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ | - 2024-01-25T16:17:18.315+0500 or - 2024-01-25T16:17:18+0500 or - 2024-01-25T16:17:18.315Z or - 2024-01-25T16:17:18Z |
| Decimal | As-is | 101.234 |
| Integer | As-is | 1234 |
| Boolean | True or False**Note**: If left empty, defaults to False | True |

#### Create Custom Rule Variables

You can define custom rule variables to capture snippets from a source event using regex matching for use with [Event Fields](#event-fields).

| Field | Instructions and Details |
| --- | --- |
| Variable Name | Enter a name for the rule variable. |
| Event Field | Enter the full path of a [CEF](/main/docs/pd-cef) or non-CEF field to read the rule variable from. For example, use `event.summary` for the **Summary** CEF field, or `raw_event.fieldname` to read from the original event's `fieldname` data. |
| Extraction Regex | Enter an [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) regular expression, which will match the part of the field you want to extract. If you specify a capture group, the part matched by the capture group will be used to set the rule variable. Otherwise, the entire match will be used. |

You may use **Sample Events** on the right as a reference for rule variables by clicking **Show Details**. You may add multiple rule variables by clicking **Add Variable** in the upper right of the Customize Event Fields panel, or delete rule variables by clicking the  icon directly to the right of the rule variable.

#### Alert Data

| Alert Action | Instructions and Details |
| --- | --- |
| Set Severity | To set [severity](/main/docs/pd-cef#pd-cef-fields), check the **Set Severity** checkbox and select **info, error, warning or critical** from the dropdown. Severity can be used for [Dynamic Notifications](/main/docs/dynamic-notifications), which are defined by the service settings. To use Dynamic Notifications, the events must be routed to a service that sets Dynamic Notifications based on severity levels. With severity controlled via Event Orchestrations and the service configured to use dynamic notifications, you can [control the incident urgency](/main/docs/dynamic-notifications#using-severity-to-control-urgency). |
| Set a custom trigger/resolve action ([Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration)) | If you would like to automatically trigger or resolve an alert based on your event rule's conditions, in the section **Override the given `event_action` behavior**, check the box for either **Always trigger an alert** or **Always resolve an alert**. |

### Automation

#### Webhooks

Webhook Actions allow response teams to easily define a dynamic webhook through an Orchestration and send a custom payload to a specified endpoint. This enables responders to automate actions like restarting a server, clearing logs, and reverting bad deploys.

> 📘 Availability
> --------------
> 
> Webhooks are available with [Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration).

The payload can be set using a combination of several predefined variables. Automated Triggers can be created using Service Orchestration rules.

| Option | Instructions and Details |
| --- | --- |
| Enable webhook | Check the **checkbox** to enable and then select if the webhook should be manually or automatically triggered. |
| Name | Enter a **button name**. |
| API Endpoint | Enter the **API endpoint** for the payload. |
| Headers | Select the **+ Header Field** button and enter the **Name** and **Value** for the webhook header. |
| JSON Body Fields (Optional) | Enter a **name** and **value** using [rule variables](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/event-orchestration#create-custom-rule-variables) or [cache variables](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/event-orchestration-variables#step-2-create-a-new-cache-variable) to further enrich the custom action. |

#### Automation Actions

Runbook Automation Self-Hosted allows users to specify which [PagerDuty Automation Action](/main/docs/automation-actions) should be run based on an incoming event’s payload. Responders can initiate automated diagnostics or remediation as soon as an incident is created, saving critical time during major incidents, or preventing major incidents altogether.

Event Orchestration is able to automatically trigger any Automation Action that has already been created and is allowed for use on the service Event Orchestration is being used on. Please read our [Automation Actions](/main/docs/automation-actions) article to learn more about how to configure actions and their permissions.

Automation Actions can only be enabled for Service Orchestration Rules.

> 📘 Availability
> --------------
> 
> This feature is available for Business, Enterprise for Incident Management and Digital Operations (Legacy) plans that meet the following criteria:
> 
> * **Business Plans**: Accounts must have the PagerDuty AIOps and PagerDuty Automation Actions add-ons, as well as [Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration).
> * **Enterprise for Incident Management and Digital Operations (Legacy) Plans**: Accounts must have the PagerDuty Automation Actions add-on and [Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration).
> 
> Please [contact our Sales team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-sales/) if you are interested in [PagerDuty AIOps](/main/docs/aiops), and you may [fill out this form](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-us/automation-actions/) if you are interested in Automation Actions.

To select an Automation Action:

1. Select an Automation Action from the **Automation Action** dropdown. Initially this dropdown will say “No automation selected” until an Automation Action is specified.
2. Only one Automation Action can be specified per rule, however multiple Automation Actions can be triggered during incident creation by [nesting rules](#configure-a-global-or-service-orchestration-rule) one after another.

> 📘 Tip
> -----
> 
> If an Event Orchestration rule has an Automation Action specified that is no longer valid due to it being deleted or not available, the rule with the Automation Action will persist and still function, however the Automation Action will no longer trigger. Rules where this occurs will have a yellow  icon on the Automation tab when you [edit the rule](/main/docs/event-orchestration#edit-a-service-rule-on-a-global-orchestration), to indicate that the Automation Action is no longer available.

Copy Service Rules
------------------

> 📘 Copied Service Rule Limitations
> ---------------------------------
> 
> Copied service orchestration rules will persist for 5 minutes after being copied or until they are manually deleted via the successful rule copy icon located in the top right of the service orchestration canvas.
> 
> Copying Event Orchestration Routing Rules is not currently supported.

To copy an existing service orchestration rule:

1. Click the  menu shown and select **Copy Rule**.
2. An icon will appear in the top right of the service orchestration canvas indicating that a rule has been copied when this is successful. Copying a rule copies all of its conditions, actions, and action configurations.
3. Copied rules can be pasted after, before, or between any existing service orchestration rules. To paste a rule, you may either click the  button shown on the service orchestration canvas between existing rules, or click the  menu for an existing rule and select **Paste Rule**.
4. A rule creation modal will appear and it will contain all the conditions, actions, and action configurations for the rule that was copied. These conditions, actions, and action configurations can be edited, or they can be left as they are. Click **Save**.

Manage Integrations
===================

Send Events to a Global or Service Orchestration
================================================

Send Events to Global Orchestrations
------------------------------------

1. Once you have [configured a Global Orchestration](#global-orchestrations), navigate to **AIOps**  **Event Orchestration**  click the **name** of your Global Orchestration.
2. Click **Integrations** to navigate to the **Integrations** section of the Event Orchestration. Each Event Orchestration will have the following routing options for for each integration key set:
   * **Integration Key**: You may use the integration key with many of our [tool integrations](https://www.pagerduty.com/integrations/). You may also use it to send events via API (see below).
   * **Email Address**: You may use the email address with our [Email Integration](/main/docs/email-integration-guide).
   * **HTTP Endpoint for API**: You may use the integration key and our [Events API V2](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/send-an-event-events-api-v2) to send events to this endpoint.

Send Events to Service Orchestrations
-------------------------------------

1. Add your preferred [tool integration](/main/docs/services-and-integrations#section-add-integrations-to-an-existing-service) or a [Custom Event Transformer integration](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTc5-custom-event-transformer) to the service where you configured the above [Service Orchestration rule(s)](#service-orchestrations).
2. Once you have added the integration to your service, you will be directed to the Integrations tab. Find the integration that was just added in the list, click  to the right and then copy its **Integration Key**.
3. Use this integration key to complete your integration [according to its guide](https://www.pagerduty.com/integrations/), and then send test events to your service.

Switch to Service Orchestrations
================================

If your account has services that are currently using [Service Event Rules](/main/docs/rulesets#service-event-rules), you may choose to switch to Service Orchestrations, which is a more robust feature. When you switch to Service Orchestrations, events that land on the service, regardless of source, will be evaluated by Event Orchestration instead of Event Rules.

**Note**: Email events are an exception. If an email event comes in via a service-level [email integration](/main/docs/email-integration-guide), the Service Orchestration will be ignored, and only the [email filters and rules](/main/docs/email-management-filters-and-rules) are applied. In contrast, if an email comes in on a Global Orchestration, then the Global Orchestration rules are applied, followed by Service Orchestration rules, if present.

To switch to Service Orchestrations:

1. Navigate to **Services**  **Service Directory**  and select your desired **service**.
2. Select the **Settings** tab, scroll to **Event Management** and then click **Switch to Service Orchestrations**.

The service can be switched back to processing events using Event Rules using the same process.

Pause Incident Notifications
============================

As a feature of Event Orchestration, you can configure rules to create alerts in a **Suspended** state, which will pause incident creation and notifications for a predefined amount of time. During the pause period, new alerts will be viewable in the [Alerts Table](/main/docs/alerts-table) with a **Suspended** status. You can take one of two actions on a **Suspended** alert: either **Trigger** it, which will immediately create an incident and send out responder notifications, or **Resolve** it, which prevents the incident and notifications from being created altogether.

> 📘 Availability
> --------------
> 
> Pausing incident notifications is available as part of the [Advanced Event Orchestration](#advanced-event-orchestration) package. Please [contact our Sales Team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-us/#contact-sales) if you would like to upgrade to a plan with this feature.
> 
> Pausing incident notifications is only available on incidents generated by our [Events API](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/events-api-v2/overview/), and does not work with those generated from our [REST API](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/rest-api-v2/rest-api/).

To configure paused incident notifications:

1. While [configuring a Global or Service Orchestration Rule](#configure-a-global-or-service-orchestration-rule), select the **Incident Data** tab and check the box next to **Pause notifications**.
2. Enter a value (in seconds) for **Suspend alert for \_\_\_ seconds before triggering an incident**.

Select pause notifications



3. Click **Save**.

View and Take Action on Paused Alerts
-------------------------------------

To view alerts in a paused state, navigate to the **Alerts** table in the upper menu of the web app. Alerts with paused incident notifications will have a **Suspended** status:

![Suspended alert](https://files.readme.io/0057fea-delayed-incident-notif-suspended-alert.png "delayed-incident-notif-suspended-alert.png")



Suspended alert



To take action on a paused alert:

1. Click the incident **title** to view its details page.
2. On the right hand side, click **Trigger** to trigger an incident and send notifications, or **Resolve** if you would like to resolve the alert without triggering an incident/notifications. You will see a green dialog that confirms that the alert has been triggered or resolved.

FAQ

What is the difference between Event Rules and Event Orchestration?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of the new features in Event Orchestration are enhancements on Event Rules, however, there are also some substantial departures from existing event rule functionality:

* With Event Orchestration, rules are now evaluated iteratively. They start with Global Orchestration rules, which define actions to be performed before routing and end with the definition of Service Orchestration rules, allowing individual teams to define their own incident creation behavior at the service level. This is substantially different from the earlier approach, which evaluated Global Event Rules (GERs) and Service Event Rules (SERs) at the same time. This change has allowed us to remove both GERs and SERs from Event Orchestration.
* As an intentional part of this change, Event Orchestration now also supports evaluation of conditions against either raw or [PD-CEF](/main/docs/pd-cef)-formatted event payloads.
* Another substantial change with Event Orchestration is the introduction of different rule types, as well as a rigid rule structuring. This improves observability, ensures context is established when actions are taken, and streamlines rule creation.
* Event Orchestration has made improvements to integration key management by adding the ability to migrate integration keys between rulesets and orchestrations as well as the ability to combine multiple integration keys together into a single Event Orchestration, reducing the number of Global Orchestrations and Routers required to ensure events are properly normalized and directed to the right teams.

How many services can an Event Orchestration route to?
------------------------------------------------------

You can route events to as many as 1,000 services in one orchestration. However, each service can only have one routing rule.

Can a service have more than one set of Service Orchestration rules?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

No, each service can only have one set of Service Orchestration rules (orchestration rule canvas). Here, the same set of orchestration rules will be applied to all events that land on the service, which streamlines the Event Management process.

Can events be routed to a service from the Unrouted rule with Event Orchestration?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, selecting a service to route events that do not match with any of the routing rules in an orchestration is possible with Event Orchestration.

Does Event Orchestration support email events?
----------------------------------------------

Yes, Event Orchestration supports email events. Rules may be based on the content of an email by entering the email field as custom details in the event field `event.custom_details.subject`. Having email events as custom fields means email events are treated as CEF events that you can apply [Event Fields](#event-fields) to.

Does Event Orchestration support the "contains/does not contain" filter?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Event Orchestration supports the "contains/does not contain" filter. It has, however, been reworded and replaced with the "matches part/does not match part" filter.

Are condition values case sensitive with Event Orchestration?
-------------------------------------------------------------

No, condition values with Event Orchestration are case insensitive.

Does Event Orchestration support time-based conditions?
-------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can set time-based conditions with Event Orchestrations that avoid trapping events that don't match condition pairs. With Event Orchestration, events outside the set schedule will be evaluated by the next rule.

To configure more advanced time-based conditions with an `and` operator, you'll need to edit the [PagerDuty Condition Language (PCL)](#pagerduty-condition-language-pcl) directly. Please see the section [Advanced Configuration with the `and` Operator](#advanced-configuration-with-the-and-operator) for more information.

Is there a payload size limit for an Event Orchestration?
---------------------------------------------------------

Yes, the maximum payload size for an Event Orchestration is 4 MB. Orchestrations greater than 4 MB will return `413 Payload Too Large` errors and will not save. This limit is most relevant to users who manage Event Orchestration via the [REST API](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/7ba0fe7bdb26a-list-event-orchestrations) or with infrastructure-as-code tools, such as Terraform.

How many integrations can be added to an Event Orchestration?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Users can associate up to 10 integrations with one Event Orchestration.
