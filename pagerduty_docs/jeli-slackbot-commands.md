Jeli Slackbot Commands
======================

Jeli Part of PagerDuty

The [Jeli Slackbot](/main/docs/slack-integration-jeli) is a powerful tool designed to streamline incident management directly within Slack, making it easier for teams to respond swiftly and effectively to critical issues. By utilizing the various commands provided by the Jeli Slackbot, teams can efficiently manage incidents, update statuses, and keep all stakeholders informed, ultimately leading to quicker resolutions and minimized impact.

* [Help Commands](#help-commands)
* [Incident Response Commands](#incident-response-commands)
* [Incident Analysis Commands](#incident-analysis-commands)

> 📘 Availability and Configuration
> --------------------------------
> 
> * Jeli is available to customers with a standalone Jeli plan, or the Enterprise plan for Incident Management. Please contact our [Sales Team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-us/#contact-sales) to upgrade to an account plan with Jeli.
> * Depending on your Jeli account's pricing plan some commands listed below may not be available. Please contact to your account representative to upgrade your plan.
> * Please see our section on [Incident Response settings](/main/docs/jeli-settings-and-integrations#incident-response) for instructions to configure the Jeli Slackbot.

Help Commands
=============

Contextual Help
---------------

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Get a personalized list of commands based on your context, visible only to you. | `/jeli help` |


Run `/jeli help` in any Slack channel where you've added the Jeli Slackbot to see a list of available commands. The bot's response will be an ephemeral message that is only visible to you. The command `/jeli help` is contextual, meaning it will suggest different commands depending on whether you’re in an incident channel (i.e., in the middle of incident response) or trying to import data from other Slack channels. You can expand the message to see a list of all commands.

![/jeli help command](https://files.readme.io/62b4eea-Screenshot_2023-08-10_at_2.40.22_PM.png)



`/jeli help` command




List Common Actions
-------------------

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| List common actions. | `/jeli` |


If you forget any specific Jeli Slackbot commands, you can enter `/jeli` and we’ll prompt you with our most common commands.

![/jeli command](https://files.readme.io/23ab9c5-Screenshot_2023-05-04_at_5.40.05_PM_1.png)



`/jeli` command




Incident Response Commands
==========================

Open a New Incident
-------------------

| Action | Command | Aliases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initiate incident response. | `/jeli open` | `/jeli incident`, `/jeli open-incident`, `/jeli start`, `/jeli start-incident` |


Initiate incident response with a single command. Include the available information about the incident in the **Add More Details** section, and utilize any configured integrations in the Use Integrations section.

**Note**: No field is required, if you do not add a name we will generate one for you from a randomized list of adjectives and nouns.

![/jeli open command](https://files.readme.io/27b3e7a-jeliopenmodal.gif)



`/jeli open` command



We’ll send you an ephemeral message **confirming the incident has been created** with a link to the generated slack channel. We’ll also notify your selected broadcast channels that an incident has been created.

### Add More Details

Every field in this section is optional, just add what you know now such as the:

* Summary
* Severity
* Add or remove relevant Broadcast Channels
* Assign yourself to a role within response

All of these fields are editable during response as well through various slash commands.

### Use Integrations

Your [Jeli Settings and Integrations](/main/docs/jeli-settings-and-integrations) will determine the default selections on this page and can be changed on a per-incident basis here, including:

* Automatically initiate a [Zoom](/main/docs/zoom-integration-jeli) call
* Automatically initiate a [Google Meet](/main/docs/google-meet-integration-jeli) call
* Create a Primary Jira [Jira](/main/docs/jira-integration-jeli) ticket when the Jeli incident opens
  + [More information about creating Jira tickets from Jeli here](https://intercom.help/jeli/en/articles/8261145-using-our-jira-integration-to-create-link-additional-incident-tickets)
  + **Note**: Using the Primary Jira ticket integration does change the naming scheme of the incident channels.

### Incident Channel Naming

* When an incident is created the generated Slack channel name will follow this format: `#jeli-[incident number]-[incident name]`, e.g., `#jeli-29-docs-pages-are-down`.
* If you elect to have a primary Jira ticket automatically created, it will add the Jira ticket number as a prefix on the channel name as opposed to the `#jeli-` prefix: `#[jira ticket project and ticket id]-[incident name]`, e.g., `#inc-133-payroll-is-down`.
* If you do not add a name we will generate one for you from a randomized list of adjectives and nouns and the channel name will get the `#jeli-` prefix or the Jira ticket prefix based on your configurations, e.g., `#eng-34-full-lemon`.
* To distinguish demo incidents from actual events, the naming differs: `#jeli-demo-[incident name]-[YYYY-MM-DD]`, e.g., `#jeli-demo-just-testing-2023-06-20`.
* If Jeli is currently undergoing an incident of our own impacting incident creation, we have fallbacks in place which will change the name format to: `#jeli-[incident name]-[YYYY-MM-DD]`, e.g., `#jeli-emails-are-delayed-2023-06-21`.

Add a Summary to an Incident
----------------------------

| Action | Command | Aliases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quickly describe the issue and keep it updated as new information emerges. | `/jeli summary` | `/jeli update-summary` |


Type what you know about the issue so far and update it when anything significant changes.

![/jeli summary command](https://files.readme.io/6ebf60e-summary.png)



`/jeli summary` command



The summary is the main description of the incident. It is displayed in the overview responders can use to get up to speed in the incident channel. As well as in the incident notification sent to the broadcast channels, where those not involved in active response can stay up to date on the status of response.

To quickly update the status without opening a dialog box use `/jeli summary [type out summary before hitting enter]`.

Add a Severity Level to an Incident
-----------------------------------

| Action | Command | Aliases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Choose a severity level, provide context for your decision, and customize linked Slack channels. | `/jeli sev` | `/jeli severity`, `/jeli set-severity` |


Select from the severity options of **0**, **1**, and **2**, provide some in the moment context behind your decision and customize the broadcast based on the severity. Severity is not required and can be disabled by request.

![/jeli sev command](https://files.readme.io/f6fc591-_jeli_sev.png)



`/jeli sev` command



To quickly set the severity without opening a dialog box use `/jeli severity [severity level number]`.

Get an Overview of the Current Incident
---------------------------------------

| Action | Command | Aliases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Receive a comprehensive, private overview of the current incident. Automatically displayed to anyone joining the channel for the first time. | `/jeli overview` | `/jeli info` |


Enter `/jeli overview` in the Slack incident channel to receive a full overview of the current incident. The message is only visible to the person that runs the command. The overview will also be automatically shown to anyone who joins the incident channel for the first time (it will only be visible to the individual who has just joined).

![/jeli overview command](https://files.readme.io/7760ca6-_jeli_overview.png)



`/jeli overview` command



The incident overview is also what is visible in the broadcast channels and includes:

* Incident Title
* Incident Stage
* When the incident was opened
* Incident Severity
* Link to the incident Slack channel

![/jeli ic command](https://files.readme.io/fedfa5a-jelisetic.png)



`/jeli ic` command



When an incident commander is set, we update the role in the overview and broadcast channels. We also ping the assignee in the incident channel with the configured role prompt, and DM them the same prompt for easy reference.

Update an Incident’s Stage
--------------------------

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Change the incident stage as you gather new information, with prompts to add context for stakeholder updates and incident review. | `/jeli stage` |


Incidents often don’t follow the same path every time. Throughout response you can change the stage of the incident as you gain new information and pivot into different efforts.

The bot will prompt you to add some context to what led to those changes, to help inform stakeholders and give you a record free of hindsight biases for your incident review.

![/jeli stage command](https://files.readme.io/e77f040-__jeli_stage.png)



`/jeli stage` command



Jeli incident stages are: **Investigating**, **Identified**, **Paused**, **Mitigated** and **Closed**. Having an understanding of “where we are within the incident” breaks the incident into smaller chunks and helps responders, both within engineering and on the customer communication side, orient themselves around what tasks they may be expected to perform in the next stage.

There is no single path to resolution; you can easily move back and forth between the stages as you gain new information and adjust your response.

### Set an Incident’s Stage to Mitigated

When moving the incident to the mitigated stage, we also create a Jeli [Opportunity](/main/docs/opportunities) for when you’re ready to begin your incident review. After you provide an optional reason for the stage change, you will be prompted with the option to rename the incident based on all of the information you’ve gathered throughout response, and provide a new summary.

![/jeli stage command](https://files.readme.io/fcc29af-jelistagemitigated.gif)



`/jeli stage` command



The new name and summary will be included in the opportunity created in Jeli, as well as updated in the broadcast channels in Slack.

> 📘 Slack Channel Name
> --------------------
> 
> Changing the name of the incident will not change the name of the associated incident channel in Slack. To change the name of the Slack channel, use `/jeli rename`.

Moving to the mitigated stage also means we will no longer send you status update reminders on your set intervals. We know that the time between mitigation and closing out an incident can be vary depending on your organization’s process, so feel free to take your time in this stage.

**Note**: Moving to the mitigated stage is not required to close an incident, address followups, or create a Jeli opportunity. If you skip this stage, we’ll still prompt you with those items upon closing the incident. You can also move back into the identified or investigating stages from mitigated and continue response if need be. (Status reminder intervals will be restored if you return to either identified or investigating stages.)

Close an Incident in a Mitigated Stage
--------------------------------------

| Action | Command | Aliases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Close an incident that is in the mitigated stage, ending the Jeli Slackbot's involvement and allowing you to finalize followups and updates before closing out the incident. | `/jeli close` | `/jeli close-incident`, `/jeli end`, `/jeli end-incident` |


Enter `/jeli close` to close an incident in the mitigated stage. Closing an incident will end the [Jeli Slackbot's](/main/docs/slack-integration-jeli) involvement in the incident channel. Since you have already mitigated the incident, closing it will look a little different than if you are closing it from an [investigating or identified stage](#close-an-incident-in-an-investigating-or-identified-stage-jeli-close).

You will be prompted to fill out the close modal and any followups you created during the incident will appear after you close the incident with options to:

* **Schedule a reminder**
* **Edit** the followup
* **Mark Done** if you've completed the followup

![/jeli close command](https://files.readme.io/d0dd848-closing_an_incident.gif)



`/jeli close\` command



We will update the Jeli opportunity with any messages sent in the incident channel since mitigation, and notify you when that is complete. We will also set the final status update with a link to the Jeli opportunity.

![Closed Jeli incident](https://files.readme.io/9985e4b-ephemeral_message.png)



Closed Jeli incident



The broadcast channels will be updated as well, moving the incident stage to closed, setting an incident closed time, and linking to the Jeli opportunity.

### Close an Incident in the Investigating or Identified Stage

Enter `/jeli close` to close an incident that is in the investigating or identified stages. You will be prompted with the option to rename the incident based on all of the information you’ve gathered throughout response, update severity, provide a new summary, and address any followups. The new name and summary will be included in the opportunity that is created in Jeli, as well as updated in Slack broadcast channels.

> 📘 Slack Channel Name
> --------------------
> 
> Changing the name of the incident will not change the name of the associated incident channel in Slack. To change the name of the Slack channel, use `/jeli rename`.

![/jeli close command](https://files.readme.io/21b4682-closing_an_unmitigated_incident.gif)



`/jeli close` command



If you attempt to close an unmitigated incident, you will be prompted to *optionally* change the incident stage to mitigated.

Closing the incident ends [Jeli Slackbot's](/main/docs/slack-integration-jeli) involvement in the incident channel, and creates an opportunity in the Jeli web app for incident review. Jeli will then update the channel with a final status indicating that the incident is closed and provide a link to the [Opportunity](/main/docs/opportunities).

![Closed Jeli incident](https://files.readme.io/84b06f2-unmitigated_close_in_channel.png)



Closed Jeli incident



The broadcast channels will be updated as well, moving the incident stage to closed, setting an incident closed time, and linking to the Jeli opportunity.

Create Followups
----------------

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Create followup tasks. | `/jeli remind` |


Create followups to remind yourself or others what to work on once impact is mitigated.

![/jeli remind command](https://files.readme.io/a7926ea-followup.png)



`/jeli remind` command



To quickly create a followup without opening a dialog box use `/jeli remind [me or @user] [type out follw up before hitting enter]`.

### Address Followups

When an incident is moved to the mitigated stage, Jeli sends the incident channel the list of followup items you asked us to remind you about throughout the incident. You can choose to schedule a reminder on a followup and we’ll ping you again about that item at the time of your choosing.

![Schedule followups](https://files.readme.io/86886e7-followupsgif.gif)



Schedule followups



You can also mark the followup as done, if you’ve already addressed it, or edit the followup to add more details or to remind someone else about that item.

**Note**: Scheduled reminders for followups will not ping to remind you if the followup is marked as done, marked as ignored, or the incident is closed.

Get a List of Followups
