Teams
=====

Create Teams to customize information presented to specific users

The Teams feature allows you to group and control user access to associated PagerDuty objects, such as escalation policies, users, schedules, and services. This feature also allows for a customized view in the PagerDuty web app that only displays information related to a user’s Team. As an example, security engineers may only want to see users, incidents, schedules and services associated associated with their Team.

> 📘 Availability
> --------------
> 
> Teams are available on the following pricing plans: Business, Digital Operations (legacy) and Enterprise for Incident Management.
> 
> Starting the week of February 3, 2025, customers on Professional pricing plans can begin creating up to two Teams. We are adding this feature to the Professional pricing plan in a phased rollout. If you do not see this feature, it may not yet be available to your account.
> 
> Please [contact our Sales Team](mailto:sales@pagerduty.com) if you would like to upgrade to a plan featuring Teams.

> 🚧 Required User Permissions
> ---------------------------
> 
> * Manager, Global Admin or Account Owner base roles can create, edit, and delete Teams.
> * Global Admin or Account Owner roles can manage Primary Teams.
> * Users with an Account Owner, Global Admin, or Manager base role can set a Team to public or private.
>   + Users with a Manager *Team role* can also set the Team’s visibility to public or private.

Create a Team
=============

> 📘 Product Limits
> ----------------
> 
> * You can add up to 100 unique escalation policies per Team.
> * There is a limit of 500 users per Team.
> * Users can be on multiple Teams, but escalation policies can only be associated with one Team.
>   + Users can be on up to 400 Teams.

We recommend that you [create schedules](/main/docs/schedule-basics#create-a-schedule) and [escalation policies](/main/docs/escalation-policies#create-an-escalation-policy) before creating a Team. When you add an escalation policy to a Team, the escalation policy's users and schedules will be automatically assigned to your Team. Please read [Team Association Behavior](#team-association-behavior) above for more information.

1. Go to **People**  **Teams** and click **New Team**.
2. Enter a **Name** for the Team and *optionally* add **[Tags](/main/docs/contextual-search)**.
3. Click **Save** to continue.
4. You will be directed to the Team’s details page. Click **Edit Team** on the right.
5. Search and select the **Escalation Policies** or **Users** that you would like to add to this Team.
   * **Note**: When you add an escalation policy to a Team, associated users, schedules and services will be automatically added to the Team, too. You may also *optionally* add individual users to the Team if they are not on a selected the escalation policy.
6. Click **Save**.

Edit or Delete Teams
--------------------

1. Navigate to **People**  **Teams** and click the  to the right of your desired Team.

* **If you are editing a Team**: Select **Edit** from the dropdown. You may edit the **Name** by entering a new name. You may also edit **Escalation Policies**, **Users** and **Tags** by searching and selecting them from their fields. To remove escalation policies, users or tags, click  to the left of the object. When you are finished editing, click **Save**.
* **If you are deleting a Team**: Select **Delete** from the dropdown. A dialog will appear that will prompt you to **Edit Rulesets, Escalation Policies, Services and Schedules** and **Reassign Incidents** associated with the Team, with the option to reassign incidents to another team via the dropdown. Once you have performed these tasks, click **Delete Team**.

### Edit Team Roles

Please read [Manage Users: Edit Team Roles](/main/docs/users#edit-team-roles) for more information.

### Manage Team Business Service Subscriptions

Please see our section on [Subscribe Users and Teams to Business Services](/main/docs/business-service-subscription#subscribe-users-and-teams-to-business-services).

Team Association Behavior
=========================

Accounts with the [Advanced Permissions](/main/docs/advanced-permissions) feature can group PagerDuty objects (e.g., users, schedules, services, and escalation policies) by associating them with a Team. When an escalation policy is added to a Team, the users, schedules and services associated with that escalation policy are also added to the Team. PagerDuty will also determine a user’s access level to Team objects based on their [Team role](/main/docs/advanced-permissions#team-roles). For example, a user who has a Responder role on a Team will also become a Responder on the Team's associated escalation policies, schedules and services.

In order to maintain consistent access to Team objects, please keep the following in mind:

* If you add a user to an escalation policy or schedule, PagerDuty will automatically add the user to any associated Teams. **Note**: Users added to a schedule via an [override](/main/docs/edit-schedules#create-overrides) will not inherent the Team's permissions.
* [Create a schedule](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODE4Mg-create-a-schedule) and [Update a schedule](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODE4NQ-update-a-schedule) API:
  + Adding users to a schedule via API will add the users to any associated Teams.
  + Associating a Team with a schedule via API will add the schedule’s users to the Team.
* [Create an escalation policy](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODEyNQ-create-an-escalation-policy) and [Update and escalation policy](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODEyOA-update-an-escalation-policy) API: Adding a user to an escalation policy will add the user to any associated Teams. Users may not be removed from the Team if they are still on an escalation policy that is associated with the Team.

Manage Primary Team
===================

> 📘 Tip
> -----
> 
> In order to set a user’s primary Team, they must already be a member of the Team.

Some organizations may want users to have primary teams for billing purposes. To designate a user's primary team:

1. Navigate to **People**  **Users** and click the **name** of the desired user.
2. Select the **Permissions & Teams** tab and click **Manage primary team** in the **Teams & Team Roles** section.
3. On the next screen you will have the option to search and select the user's desired primary team, or you may remove one by clicking **Unset primary team**. Click **Confirm Selection** to save.

![Manage primary Team](https://files.readme.io/48242fc-teams-manage-primary-team.png "teams-manage-primary-team.png")



Manage primary team



4. You will now be able to see the user's primary team in the **Teams & Team Roles** section.

![Primary team on the user profile](https://files.readme.io/cca3a7f-teams-primary-team.png "teams-primary-team.png")

Filter by Team
==============

The Team filter dropdown is available on most PagerDuty objects in the web app, such as the [Incidents page](/main/docs/navigating-the-incidents-page), [Service Directory](/main/docs/service-directory), [Users](/main/docs/advanced-permissions), [Escalation Policies](/main/docs/escalation-policies), [Insights](/main/docs/insights), etc.

To filter the UI by Team, in PagerDuty web app click the **Team** dropdown. You can choose to view **All Teams**, **My Teams**, or select **specific Team(s)**.

When you select a Team filter on one page, the filter stay in effect as you navigate to other pages. For example, to quickly see all users in a Team, go to the Team dropdown menu and select your preferred Team, and then go to **People**  **Users**. You will only see users associated with the selected Team.

Your filter selection will not impact the view that other users see in their accounts.

Team Privacy
============

With [Advanced Permissions](/main/docs/advanced-permissions#team-privacy), Teams have the option to be set to **Private** or **Public**. By default, all Teams are public.

* **Public**: Teams can be viewed and accessed by users outside of those Teams.
* **Private**: Teams cannot be viewed and accessed by users outside of those Teams, except for users with Global Admin or Account Owner base roles; these users have access to all private Teams.

When a Team is set to private, users who are *not* part of that Team:

| Will *not* Be Able To | *Will* Be Able To |
| --- | --- |
| - View the Team’s schedules, escalation policies, services, and incidents - Find the Team’s service or escalation policy when creating a new incident - Find the Team’s escalation policy when reassigning or adding responders to an incident - Find the Team when adding subscribers to an incident - Find the Team on the Team lens dropdown, on the **People**  **Teams** page, or on the profile page of a user associated with the Team | - Find users associated with the private Team on the **People**  **Users** page - Find users on the private Team when creating, reassigning, adding responders, or adding subscribers to an incident - Find users on the private Team when creating a schedule override |

**Note**: Team privacy does not currently apply to the following pages or configuration objects:

* [Incident Workflows](/main/docs/incident-workflows)
* [Postmortems](/main/docs/postmortems)
* Analytics

> 📘 Known Issues
> --------------
> 
> Depending on the method used, there are some known inconsistencies related to incidents' visibility when a service is added to a private Team.
> 
> **Method 1 (Recommended):**  If an admin changes a service's *existing Team's visibility from public to private*, incidents associated with the private Team's service and escalation policy will only be available to members of the private Team, Global Admin users, and the Account Owner (i.e., privileged users). This is the expected behavior.
> 
> **Method 2:** If an admin changes a service's *existing, public Team to a different, private Team*, the old Team's incident permissions will govern the visibility of historical incidents. This has the effect that already existing incidents will remain visible to non-privileged users on the Incidents overview page, as well as on incidents' detail pages.
> 
> **Method 3:** If an admin associates a *service, which currently does not have a Team, with a private Team*, historical incidents will be visible to non-privileged users on the Incidents overview page, however they will not be able to view incident details.

Edit Team Privacy
-----------------

1. To edit a Team’s privacy, navigate to **People**  **Teams** and select your desired **Team**.
2. Navigate to the **Users** tab on the Team’s page and set **External Visibility** to either **Public** or **Private**.

The Team that an incident is associated with is based on the [service](/main/docs/services-and-integrations#create-a-service) where the incident was triggered. For example, if an incident is triggered on a service associated with the Network Operations Team, then the incident is associated with the Network Operations Team. If the incident is reassigned to an escalation policy or user that belongs to a different Team, then the incident will still be associated with the Network Operations Team.

Any users who are assigned to the incident will be able to respond to it, even if they are not associated with the Network Operations Team. These users *must* be directly assigned to the incident to take action on it. They will show up under **Assigned to** when viewing the incident in the web app, or **Assignees** in the REST API. However, they won’t see the incident on their Incidents dashboard if filtering by My Teams.

Any users who are *not* assigned to the incident AND who don’t have access to respond to incidents associated with the Network Operations team (e.g., a user with an Observer or Restricted Access base role and no Team role or object role on the Network Operations Team or its associated objects) will not be able to respond to the incident.

With that being said, if there is a user who needs to be able to respond to incidents for all or multiple Teams, make sure that the user has any of the following role configurations:

* A **Responder** base role. This will allow them to respond to incidents associated with any Team.
* A **Responder** or **Manager** role on any Team for which they need to respond to incidents.
* A **Responder** or **Manager** object role on any service for which they need to respond to incidents.

Rest API Access
===============

All users can [create personal REST API keys](/main/docs/api-access-keys#generate-a-user-token-rest-api-key)  that matches their user permissions. For example, a user with a **Manager** base role can create a personal API key that will allow them to edit a schedule. However, they will not be able to add new users to the account because their access level does not allow this.

Global Admins and the Account Owner can create and manage [global API access keys](/main/docs/api-access-keys), which typically offer more API access than user-specific API keys.
