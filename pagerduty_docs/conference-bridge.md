Conference Bridge
=================

Add a conference bridge in order to easily connect and collaborate during major incident response

A conference bridge is a central channel where all responders can gather for collaboration. Conference bridges allow responders to connect to your preferred web conferencing provider directly from an incident, via phone, or meeting URL. You can use the same conference bridge for all major incidents, or configure multiple as needed.

There are two ways to create conference bridges in your PagerDuty account:

* [Create an Account-Level Conference Bridge](#section-create-an-account-level-conference-bridge)
* [Create a Service-Level Conference Bridge](#section-create-a-service-level-conference-bridge)

And there are two ways to add a conference bridge to an incident:

* [Manually Add a Conference Bridge to an Incident via Add Responders](#section-manually-add-a-conference-bridge-to-an-incident-via-add-responders)
* [Add a Conference Bridge to an Incident with an Incident Workflow](#add-a-conference-bridge-to-an-incident-with-an-incident-workflow)

> 📘 Availability
> --------------
> 
> The conference bridge feature is available on current Business, Enterprise for Incident Management and Digital Operations (Legacy) plans. Please contact our [Sales Team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-sales/) if you would like to upgrade to a plan with the conference bridge feature.

> 👍 Best Practice
> ---------------
> 
> For an in-depth look at how to incorporate conference bridges into your organization's processes, please refer to our [Incident Response](https://response.pagerduty.com/) best practice guide.

Create an Account-Level Conference Bridge
=========================================

Conference bridges can be added as account-level extensions. This provides users with a list of persistent conference lines to choose from when [triggering an incident](/main/docs/incidents#trigger-an-incident).

1. In the PagerDuty web app, navigate to **Integrations**  **Extensions**.
2. Select the **Conference Bridges** tab and then click **New Conference Bridge**.
3. Enter the following based on your preferences. You must enter either a Conference Number or Conference URL, or you may enter both options:

| Field | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| **Label** | Enter a label for the conference bridge. This will be the label as it will appear in the selection drop-down menu. |
| **Description** | Enter a brief description of the conference bridge. |
| **Conference Number** | Enter the phone number users will call into, if applicable. Phone numbers should be in the following format: `415-555-1212,,,,1234#`, where a comma (`,`) represents a one-second wait and pound (`#`) completes access code input. |
| **Conference URL** | Enter a meeting URL, if applicable. |

4. Click **Save**. The conference bridge will be available as an option under **Advanced Options** when [creating a new incident](/main/docs/incidents#trigger-an-incident-via-web-app).

![A screenshot of the PagerDuty UI indicating how to add a conference bridge to an incident](https://files.readme.io/4886556bb0ed9f5ceeb419ebd0392ddb3df6d0a3dbbba99727df100f364e1d09-select_a_conference_bridge.png "conference-bridge-account-level.png")



Add a conference bridge



Edit an Account-Level Conference Bridge
---------------------------------------

1. Navigate to **Integrations**  **Extensions** and select the **Conference Bridges** tab.
2. Click the  icon to the right of your desired conference bridge. Edit the necessary details and then click **Save**.

Delete an Account-Level Conference Bridge
-----------------------------------------

1. Navigate to **Integrations**  **Extensions** and select the **Conference Bridges** tab.
2. Click the  icon to the right of your desired conference bridge. In the confirmation dialog that appears, click **Delete**.

Create a Service-Level Conference Bridge
========================================

> 📘 Conference Bridge for All Incidents
> -------------------------------------
> 
> When adding a conference bridge to a service, it is important to note that the conference bridge information will appear on **all incidents that trigger on that service**. We recommend adding a conference bridge to services dedicated to critical incidents that require a bridge.

1. In the PagerDuty web app, navigate to **Services**  **Service Directory**.
2. Click the **name** of your desired service and select the **Settings** tab. Scroll down to **Coordinate Responders and Stakeholders** and click **Edit** on the right.
3. Enter the conference bridge information for your service. You must enter either a Conference Bridge Dial-In Number or Conference Bridge Meeting URL, or you may enter both options:
   * **Conference Bridge Dial-In Number**: Enter the phone number users will call into, if applicable. Phone numbers should be in the following format: `415-555-1212,,,,1234#`, where a comma (`,`) represents a one-second wait and pound (`#`) completes access code input.
   * **Conference Bridge Meeting URL**: Enter a meeting URL, if applicable.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

When an incident is triggered on your service you will see the conference bridge information in the web app and in email notifications.

Conference bridge details



Edit a Service-Level Conference Bridge
--------------------------------------

1. Navigate to **Services**  **Service Directory** and select the **service** containing the conference bridge that you would like to edit.
2. Select the **Settings** tab, scroll to **Coordinate Responders and Stakeholders** and click **Edit** to the right.
3. Edit the **Conference Bridge Dial-In Number** and/or **Conference Bridge Meeting URL** as needed.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

Delete a Service-Level Conference Bridge
----------------------------------------

1. Navigate to **Services**  **Service Directory** and select the **service** containing the conference bridge that you would like to delete.
2. Select the **Settings** tab, scroll to **Coordinate Responders and Stakeholders** and click **Edit** to the right.
3. Remove the **Conference Bridge Dial-In Number** and/or **Conference Bridge Meeting URL**, where applicable, and then click **Save Changes**.

Manually Add a Conference Bridge to an Incident via Add Responders
==================================================================

If you do not have conference bridge information added to your service, you can use the **Add Responders** feature to input the conference bridge information.

> 🚧 Add Responders Requirement
> ----------------------------
> 
> If you wish to manually add a conference bridge to an open incident, you will need to use the add responders feature. Alternatively, you can also add a new conference bridge using an [Incident Workflow](#add-a-conference-bridge-to-an-incident-with-an-incident-workflow) with a manual trigger.

1. After an incident has been triggered, **acknowledge** the incident and click **Add Responders**.
2. Select the **Users** and/or **Escalation Policies** you wish to add as a responder (required for this option).
3. Under **Add a conference bridge**, if you already have an account-level or service-level Conference Bridge configured, you can use the dropdown to **Select a pre-configured conference bridge**. Alternatively, you can add the details manually by selecting **Manually create conference bridge** and entering the following:

| Field | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| **Label** | A label for the conference bridge. Enter up to four characters. |
| **Dial-in Number** | Enter the phone number users will call into, if applicable. Phone numbers should be in the following format: `415-555-1212,,,,1234#`, where a comma (`,`) represents a one-second wait and pound (`#`) completes access code input. |
| **Meeting link URL** | Enter a meeting URL, if applicable. |

4. *Optional*: Click **Add Dial-In Number** to add additional conference bridges.
5. Click **Save**.

Requests will be sent to responders, who can review conference bridge details on the incident details page and in responder email notifications.

Add a Conference Bridge to an Incident with an Incident Workflow
================================================================

> 📘 Availability
> --------------
> 
> Incident Workflows are included with our Business, Enterprise for Incident Management and Digital Operations (Legacy) pricing plans. Please [contact our Sales team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-us/#contact-sales) to upgrade to a plan with Incident Workflows.

Adding a conference bridge as part of an Incident Workflow allows you to easily mobilize responders, either when certain conditions are met or with the click of a button. Please read [Incident Workflows](/main/docs/incident-workflows#create-an-incident-workflow-from-scratch) for instructions on adding a conference bridge to a workflow.

Join a Conference Bridge as a Responder
=======================================

Conference bridge information is available within incidents in the web app, email notifications, Slack (if you have a [Slack integration](https://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/slack-integration-guide/) configured) and via voice call. When referencing the web app, email notifications and Slack, responders will need to manually dial into the conference bridge or click its link. For voice call notifications, responders have the option of using the [One Touch To Join](/main/docs/conference-bridge#section-one-touch-to-join-conference-bridge) feature.

Example Responder Notifications
-------------------------------

### Conference Bridge Information in Voice Call Notifications

When responders receive voice call notifications, they will hear the following prompt:

> PagerDuty Alert. Please help me with [Incident Title]
> 
> Press `[#]` to accept  
> 
> Press `[#]` to decline

> 📘 Response Numbers
> ------------------
> 
> The numbers that users are prompted to enter when accepting or declining a responder request may vary.

**By default, users will not receive conference bridge information in the voice call**. Once accepted, they will then need to check the incident in the [web app](#conference-bridge-information-in-the-web-app), an [email notification](#conference-bridge-information-in-email-notifications) or a [Slack notification](#conference-bridge-information-in-slack-notifications) to obtain the conference bridge information and enter the bridge manually.

**If you would like responders to be able to join conference bridges via voice call notifications**, you can use our [One Touch To Join Conference Bridge](#one-touch-to-join-conference-bridge) add-on feature.

> One Touch to Join Conference Bridge works with [Conference Bridge](#create-a-service-level-conference-bridge) and [Add Responders](/main/docs/add-responders), which are features available on Business, Enterprise for Incident Management and Digital Operations (Legacy) plans. Please [reach out to our Sales team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-us/) if you are interested in a plan with these features.

The One Touch To Join Conference Bridge feature enables rapid response team assembly by giving responders a push-button means of joining a conference bridge. This feature relies on two core PagerDuty Platform features: [Conference Bridge](/main/docs/conference-bridge#create-a-service-level-conference-bridge) and [Add Responders](/main/docs/add-responders). When responders are added to an incident and receive a voice call, they will receive the option to “Join the bridge” which will immediately add them to the conference call. The One Touch To Join Conference Bridge solution works with your existing direct-dial conference bridge provider and reduces effective time-to-engage and resolution time for major incidents.

### Configure One Touch To Join Conference Bridge

1. [Configure a conference bridge](/main/docs/conference-bridge#create-a-service-level-conference-bridge).
2. Responders must have the following:  
   
   a. [A phone number listed](/main/docs/user-profile#contact-information) in the **Contact Information** tab of their PagerDuty user profile.  
   
   b. [A high-urgency notification rule](/main/docs/user-profile#notification-rules) in the **Notification Rules** tab using this phone number in their user profile.

3. During an incident with a conference bridge, add responders by using the [Add Responders](/main/docs/add-responders) feature, or at scale with [Incident Workflows](/main/docs/incident-workflows#create-an-incident-workflow-from-scratch).

Any requested responder with the above configuration will receive a voice call with the following phrasing:

> PagerDuty Alert. Please help with [Incident Title]
> 
> Press 1 to join the bridge  
> 
> Press 2 to accept the request  
> 
> Press 3 to decline the request

The following table lists the effects of each response to the voice call:

| Response to Voice Call | Result | Responder Status | Conference Bridge Impact | Incident Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 - Join the Bridge | Responder joins the bridge and the Responder Request is accepted. | Responder Status is marked as **Joined**, as per the [icon on the Responders box in the Incident Detail page](/main/docs/add-responders#status-of-responders). | Responder automatically joins to the bridge for the incident. No manual dialing required. | An Incident Timeline entry is created showing when the Responder joined the call. |
| 2 - Accept the Request | Responder Request is accepted. | Responder Status is marked as **Joined**. | The responder will have to manually dial into the bridge and their participation will not be visible on the Timeline. | An Incident Timeline entry is created showing this accepted request. |
| 3 - Decline the Request | Responder Request is declined. | Responder Status marked as **Declined**. If the added responder is part of an escalation policy, the responder on the next escalation policy level would be paged with an Add Responder request. | None | An Incident Timeline entry is created showing this declined request. |
| No Answer | Responder Request is unanswered. | Responder Status remains marked as **Pending**. If the added responder is part an escalation policy, the responder on the next escalation policy level would be paged with an Add Responder request. | None | None |

#### Logged Events

Whenever a responder who has joined the bridge via One Touch To Join disconnects, or when bridge call ends, the [Incident Timeline](/main/docs/incidents#incident-timeline) will reflect these departures as well. This information will be made available in [Postmortems and Jeli Post Incident Reviews](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/postmortems).

#### Connection Duration

You can add as many responders to your conference bridge as your conference provider allows. One Touch To Join calls will disconnect after **two hours**. If the responder stills need to participate in the call, they can manually redial the bridge based on the conference details attached to the PagerDuty incident.

#### Missed Calls

If a responder misses a voice call, PagerDuty will attempt to reach them using each of the configured contact methods used by their [high-urgency notification rules](/main/docs/user-profile#notification-rules). We recommend configuring at least two [contact methods](/main/docs/user-profile#contact-information) so that if a notification for one channel is missed, context is provided in another channel. For example, if a user misses a voice call, they will still be able to manually join the conference bridge using information found in the web app, email notification or Slack message, but they will not be able to use One Touch To Join.

### Supported Countries

The One Touch To Join feature is supported in over 30 of our highest responder countries. Countries are classified in one of two groups: Base or Premium (see the table below). The One Touch To Join feature is available when both of the following are true:

* The conference bridge is hosted in a Base country.
