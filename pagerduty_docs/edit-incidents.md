Edit Incidents
==============

Merge, snooze and add notes to incidents

When an incident triggers, there are a number of manual actions you may wish to take, depending on your workflow or the specifics of the situation:

* [Merge Incidents](#merge-incidents)
* [Snooze an Incident](#snooze-an-incident)
* [Edit Incident Title](#edit-incident-title)
* [Edit Incident Priority](#edit-incident-priority)
* [Edit Incident Urgency](#edit-incident-urgency)
* [Edit Incident Duration](#edit-incident-duration)
* [Add a Note to an Incident](#add-a-note-to-an-incident)
* [Define Technical Service Dependencies](#define-technical-service-dependencies)

Merge Incidents
===============

Merging more than one incident into a single incident streamlines the notification and resolution process. Merging incidents also allows you to consolidate alert information into a single incident, helping responders identify an issue’s root cause and impact.

> 🚧 Alert Maximum
> ---------------
> 
> An incident cannot have more than 1000 alerts. This means that you will not be able to merge incidents if their combined total exceeds 1000 alerts.

Merge Incidents in the Web App
------------------------------

There are two places to merge incidents in the web app:

* [On the Incidents Page](#on-the-incidents-page)
* [On an Incident’s Detail Page](#on-an-incidents-detail-page)

### On the Incidents Page

If there are two or more triggered incidents on the **Incidents** page, you can merge them into a single incident. When you merge incidents, they will appear as a single incident with multiple alerts.

1. On the web app’s **Incidents** page, select the **checkboxes** next to the incidents you’d like to merge together.
2. Click **Merge Incidents**.

![Merge incidents on the Incidents page](https://files.readme.io/7906e23-image5.png "Merge incidents on the Incidents page")



Merge incidents on the Incidents page



3. In the modal, select which incident you would like alerts to be grouped under.
   * In the field **Select the incident to merge into**, you can sort by **Selected Incidents**, **Assigned to me**, or **Assigned to my team**. After selecting an incident, you can *optionally* update the **Incident Title**, if a different title would more accurately describe the issue.
4. Click **Merge incidents and [X] Alerts**.

![Merge Incidents and 2 Alerts](https://files.readme.io/263be81-image6.png "Merge Incidents and 2 Alerts")



Merge Incidents and 2 Alerts



The incident dashboard will then show a single incident. When you select the incident to view its detail screen, you can review alerts from all incidents you selected in step 1 under the **Alerts** section.

![Merged alerts](https://files.readme.io/38d781c-image9.png "Merged alerts")



Merged alerts



### On an Incident’s Detail Page

You can also merge incidents on an incident’s details page:

1. Select an incident to view its details page, then click **More**  **Merge with Another Incident**.
2. Enter an **incident number** and click **Find Incident**.
3. Click **Merge Incident and [X] Alerts**.

![Merge incidents on the details page](https://files.readme.io/2f9dc36-image10.png "Merge incidents on the details page")



Merge incidents on the details page



Merge Incidents in the Mobile App
---------------------------------

1. On the Open Incidents screen, tap the  in the top right and tap **Select Incidents**.
2. Select the **radio buttons** to the left of the incidents you would like to merge, tap the  again and then select **Merge**.
3. Select the **incident** that you would like to merge into. You will see a confirmation dialog at the bottom of the screen stating that the incidents have been merged.

Merge Behavior
--------------

* When you merge multiple incidents together, alerts will be consolidated into the target incident. The other selected incidents will be resolved, with the resolution reason listed as **Merged**. These incidents will reference the target incident that you selected in the merge dialog.

![Merged incidents](https://files.readme.io/dbb9a5c-editing-incidents-merged-resolved-incidents.png "Merged incidents")



Merged incidents



* The deduplication key, called the **Alert Key**, will not be changed, but it will move so that it is under a single incident with other deduplication keys.
* If you are using a bidirectional integration, such as the Slack integration, merged incidents will display as resolved and reference the new target incident where all alerts are aggregated.

![Merged incident in Slack](https://files.readme.io/1f3eb3e-editing-incidents-slack-merged-incidents.png "Merged incident in Slack")



Merged incident in Slack



* Responders from source incidents will not be merged into the target incident. Instead, the target incident’s responders are preserved and all alerts will be assigned to them. These users may be viewed under the **Timeline** tab on the incident's page.
* Subscribers from source incidents will not be merged into the target incident. They will need to be [re-added](/main/docs/business-service-subscription#subscribe-users-and-teams-to-incidents) to the target incident.

Move Alerts to Another Incident
-------------------------------

If an alert is incorrectly merged, there are two ways to move alerts either to a new or existing incident:

* [On the Incident’s Page](#on-the-incidents-page)
* [On an Alert’s Page](#on-an-alerts-page)

### On the Incident’s Page

You can move an alert to another incident on an incident’s details page in the web app:

1. Navigate to an incident’s detail page  scroll to the **Alerts** section.
2. Next to the alert that you’d like to move, select   **Move to a new incident** *or* **Move to an existing incident**.

![Move alerts on the Incidents page](https://files.readme.io/2e249fe-image1.png "Move alerts on the Incidents page")



Move alerts on the Incidents page



3. Confirm your selection in the modal that appears.

### On an Alert’s Page

You may also move an alert to another incident on an alert’s details page in the web app:

1. Navigate to an incident’s detail page  in the **Alerts** section, click an alert’s **Summary** to navigate to its details page.
2. Click **Move to Another Incident**.

![Move alert to another incident](https://files.readme.io/326b084-image12.png "Move alert to another incident")



Move alert to another incident



3. Enter an **incident number** and click **Find Incident**.
4. Click **Move Alert**.

Merged Incidents and Webhooks
-----------------------------

If you have configured [webhooks](/main/docs/webhooks), merging alerts into another incident will send a webhook for the source incident with a `resolve_reason` of `merged`.

Webhooks will continue to update the target incident, but all incidents that were merged into the target incident will be updated as resolved.

Likewise, webhook updates will only continue to be sent for services with open incidents (i.e., **triggered** or **acknowledged**). For example, if an incident from Service A is merged into an incident on Service B, only webhooks on Service B will continue to be sent.

For incidents that were resolved when they merged into a target incident, resolve webhooks will trigger (if configured). These incidents will contain a reference to the target incident. In the webhook body, the `resolve_reason` object will detail information about the target incident and indicate that the `type` is `merge_resolve_reason`.

Snooze an Incident
==================

Responders can use the snooze feature to keep an acknowledged incident from escalating while they’re working on the issue. Users can snooze an incident for the following time intervals: **1 hour**, **4 hours**, **8 hours**, **24 hours** or **Other**. If you choose **Other**, the maximum length is 168 hours (i.e., a week).

Snooze is only available for acknowledged incidents. If a user does not resolve the incident before the snooze timer expires, the incident will return to a triggered state and will begin notifying the user again according to their notification rules. If a different user has come on call since the incident triggered (due to a rotation on a [schedule](/main/docs/schedule-basics), for example), both users will be notified.

The incident log will capture all snooze actions taken on an incident.

You can snooze an incident from either the [web app](#in-the-web-app) or [mobile app](#in-the-mobile-app).

In the Web App
--------------

1. **Acknowledge** the incident. **Acknowledge** will be replaced with **Snooze**.
2. Select **Snooze** and the length of time you’d like to snooze the incident.

![Snooze an incident](https://files.readme.io/d9ea5d1-editing-incidents-snooze-incident.png "Snooze an incident")



Snooze an incident



> 📘 Add an Escalation Policy as a Responder
> -----------------------------------------
> 
> If a user [adds responders](/main/docs/add-responders#add-responders-to-an-incident) to an incident and selects an escalation policy, snoozing will not prevent the incident from escalating.

If a user selects **Other**, they will have the option to select a custom snooze time, snooze until a time tomorrow, or base your snooze on a service’s [support hours](/main/docs/service-settings#section-enable-urgencies).

![Snooze an incident](https://files.readme.io/0dc0f3c-image3.png "Snooze an incident")



Snooze an incident



In the Mobile App
-----------------

1. **Acknowledge** the incident. **Acknowledge** will be replaced with **Snooze**.
2. Select **Snooze** and the length of time you’d like to snooze the incident:
   * **1 hour**
   * **4 hours**
   * **24 hours**
   * **for**
   * **until**

![Snooze an incident in the mobile app](https://files.readme.io/f14a8bc-image2.jpg "Snooze an incident in the mobile app")



Snooze an incident in the mobile app



Reassign a Snoozed Incident
---------------------------

[Reassigning](/main/docs/reassigning-and-delegating-incidents) a snoozed incident will cancel the snooze timer. The [acknowledgement timeout](/main/docs/configurable-service-settings#acknowledgement-timeout) will reset to the triggering service’s default value.

Acknowledge a Snoozed Incident
------------------------------

If another user acknowledges a snoozed incident, the incident exits the snoozed state and the [acknowledgement timeout](/main/docs/configurable-service-settings#acknowledgement-timeout) starts fresh.

Auto-Resolution and Snooze
--------------------------

Services can be configured to automatically resolve an incident after a predetermined period of time passes — this is called [auto-resolution](/main/docs/configurable-service-settings#auto-resolution). If an incident is snoozed past the time when auto-resolution would have resolved the incident (for example, auto-resolution is configured to resolve incidents after six hours, but the incident is snoozed for 12 hours), the incident will remain snoozed and *not* automatically resolve. Additionally, when an incident returns to an acknowledged or triggered state, the auto-resolution timer resets.

Edit Incident Title
===================

It’s possible you’ll need to change an incident’s title as it progresses or as the nature of the underlying issue becomes more clear.

Edit Incident Title in the Web App
----------------------------------

1. Select an incident’s **Title** to navigate to its details page.
2. To the right of the incident’s title, click  **Edit**.
3. Update the title.
4. Click **Save**.

Edit Incident Title in the Mobile App
-------------------------------------

1. Select an incident to navigate to its details page.
2. With the **Triage** tab selected, tap **Edit Title**.
3. Enter a new title.
4. Tap **Save**.

Edit Incident Priority
======================

Incident Priority lets responders know an incident's relative importance (e.g., P-1, P-2, etc.). Users can adjust an incident's priority if its impact grows or shrinks during the course of response, for example. Read [Incident Priority](/main/docs/incident-priority#prioritize-an-incident) for more information.

Edit Incident Urgency
=====================

If it becomes clear during the course of an incident that it should have a different [urgency](/main/docs/configurable-service-settings#notification-urgency), responders can edit the urgency.

> 🚧 Editing Urgency Unacknowledges Incidents
> ------------------------------------------
> 
> If an incident is acknowledged and then its urgency is edited from low to high, then the incident will be [unacknowledged](/main/docs/incidents#unacknowledge-an-incident). Escalation will then continue notifying responders using their high-urgency notification rules.

Edit Incident Urgency in the Web App
------------------------------------

1. Select an incident’s **Title** to navigate to its details page.
2. Next to **Urgency**, click the dropdown and select **High** or **Low**.

![Edit incident urgency](https://files.readme.io/a4f2900-editing-incidents-edit-incident-urgency.png "Edit incident urgency")



Edit incident urgency



Edit Incident Urgency in the Mobile App
---------------------------------------

1. Select an incident to navigate to its details page.
2. With the **Triage** tab selected, tap **Change to Low/High Urgency**.
3. Confirm your selection by tapping **Change Urgency**.

Edit Incident Duration
======================

> 📘 Incident Status Requirement and Pricing Plan Availability
> -----------------------------------------------------------
> 
> You can edit an incident’s duration once it is resolved. This feature is not available while an incident is triggered or acknowledged.
> 
> Accounts on all pricing plans are able to edit a resolved incident's duration. Adjusted incident durations can be viewed in [Insights](/main/docs/insights) reports in the **User Defined Response Effort**. When this value is edited, it replaces the original **Response Effort** value for the incident, and is used for the **Total response effort** values seen in the [Service Performance](/main/docs/insights#service-performance), [Team](/main/docs/insights#team), and [Escalation Policy](/main/docs/insights#escalation-policy) Insights reports.

PagerDuty tracks incident duration (how long it took to resolve an incident) in order to calculate [metrics](/main/docs/reports), such as **Response Effort** and **MTTR** (Mean Time To Resolve).

Sometimes the actual effort you spent on an incident may be different from the amount of time it was open. In order to provide more accurate metrics in your [Intelligent Dashboards](/main/docs/intelligent-dashboards), you can adjust the incident duration to reflect the actual response effort that was required to resolve an incident. **Note**: The **User Defined Effort** metric in the [Incident Activity (Incidents List)](/main/docs/insights#incidents-list) report does reflect adjusted incident duration times.

To edit the duration of a resolved incident, in the web app:

1. On an incident’s details page, click  under **Duration** at the top right of the incident details page.

![Edit incident duration](https://files.readme.io/9610ae8-edit-incident-duration.png "Edit incident duration")



Edit incident duration



2. In the modal, enter in the **Actual effort** time that was required to resolve the incident in the following format: `xd xh xm`.
3. Click **Update Incident**.

![Update incident times](https://files.readme.io/36a82a4-update_incidents_duration.png "Update incident time")



Update incident times



> 📘 Edited Incident Durations in Insights Reports
> -----------------------------------------------
> 
> The [Insights](/main/docs/insights) feature will calculate **Response Effort** in the [Service Performance](/main/docs/insights#service-performance), [Team](/main/docs/insights#team), and [Escalation Policy](/main/docs/insights#escalation-policy) reports using the edited incident duration, if it exists.
> 
> The [Responder](/main/docs/insights#responder) report does not use edited incident durations, since response efforts in this report are calculated on a responder level, not the incident level.

Add a Note to an Incident
=========================

Incident notes help responders resolve incidents faster by adding relevant information or links. Notes can be useful for teams responding to active incidents, and they can add helpful context for later reference. Users can add notes to open and resolved incidents.

> 🚧 Limitations
> -------------
> 
> The following limitations apply to both open and resolved incidents:
> 
> * Users can add up to 2,000 notes to an incident. Additionally, incident notes are limited to 65,535 single-byte characters.
> * Once added, notes cannot be edited or deleted.

Add a Note in the Web App
-------------------------

1. On the **Incidents** page, select an incident’s **Title** to navigate to its details page.
2. In the **Notes** section on the right-hand side, enter a note in the text field and click **Add Note**.

> Adding notes using escalation policy is available as part of [Advanced Event Orchestration](/main/docs/event-orchestration#advanced-event-orchestration). Please contact our [Sales team](https://www.pagerduty.com/contact-us/#contact-sales) if you are interested in changing your pricing tier.

You can automate adding notes to incident as part of [Event Orchestration](/main/docs/event-orchestration). While [configuring a Global or Service Orchestration Rule](/main/docs/event-orchestration#configure-a-global-or-service-orchestration-rule), select the **Incident Data** tab and enter your desired text in the section **Add incident note**.

![Add a note using Event Orchestration](https://files.readme.io/4d97501-small-Add_a_note_using_Event_Orchestration.png)



Add a note using Event Orchestration



Like manually added notes, notes that are added as the result of an orchestration rule will appear on an incident's detail page under the **Notes** section. Notes added by Event Orchestration will show **An Orchestration Event Rule** as the note’s author.

Add a Note Via Event Rules
--------------------------

> ❗️ End-of-Life
> --------------
> 
> Rulesets and Event Rules webpages reached end-of-life on January 31, 2025 and are no longer visible in the PagerDuty web app. We highly recommend that you [migrate to Event Orchestration](/main/docs/migrate-to-event-orchestration) as soon as possible so you can take advantage of the new functionality, such as improved UI, rule creation, APIs and Terraform support, advanced conditions, and rule nesting.
> 
> Access and modifications to event rules are still possible via the [API](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/8bcdc5cc897b3-global-event-rules-api).

  
> 📘 Availability
> --------------
> 
> Adding notes using event rules is available on our Business, Enterprise for Incident Management and Digital Operations (Legacy) plans.

You can use event rules workflows, part of the [Rulesets](/main/docs/rulesets) feature, to add notes to incidents. Please refer to our [API](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/6f99e38bcd538-create-an-event-rule) documentation for more information on how to configure the annotation action, which will add a note to every incident that triggers as a result of the event rule.

Like manually added notes, notes that are added as the result of an event rule will appear in the incident timeline. Notes added by an event rule will list **A Global Event Rule** as the note’s author.

Define Technical Service Dependencies
=====================================

[Service dependency](/main/docs/service-profile#service-dependencies-tab) data equips users with a broader understanding of the environment surrounding their incident, allowing them to identify the root cause more efficiently. When a service is experiencing an incident, and that service has dependencies defined, relevant service dependency data will be available on the incident details page. If the service does not yet have dependencies defined, or is missing possible dependencies, responders will be able to view suggested dependencies, and easily add them.

View Technical Service Dependencies in an Incident
--------------------------------------------------

To view the impacted service’s **Technical Service Dependencies**, click an incident’s **Title** to view the incident details page. You will see the **Technical Service Dependencies** section on the right, below **Notes**.

![Technical service dependencies](https://files.readme.io/0b1411a-technical-service-dependencies-incident.png "Technical service dependencies")



Technical service dependencies



Each dependency will have the following details:

* **Service Name**
* **Status**: **Open Incidents** or **Operational** (no open incidents).

If you click the dependency’s **Service Name**, you will be able to see more granular details:

* **On Call Now**: Responder(s) currently on call for the service.
* **Open Incidents**: A list of current open incident(s) on the service.

Suggested Technical Service Dependencies in an Incident
-------------------------------------------------------

If incidents on your service tend to be followed by incidents on another service, or vice versa, suggested technical service dependencies will also be provided. If available, they will be listed under a **Suggested** header with  next to the service’s name:

![Suggested service](https://files.readme.io/6c148c7-technical-service-dependencies-suggested.png "Suggested service")



Suggested service



To add a **Suggested Service Dependency**, click the **service name**  **Add**, next to **Add this service as a dependency?**.

![Add service as a dependency](https://files.readme.io/f1bf34f-technical-service-dependencies-add-suggested.png "Add service as a dependency")



Add service as a dependency



Add Technical Service Dependencies From an Incident
---------------------------------------------------

1. Click an incident’s **Title** to view the incident details page. You will see the **Technical Service Dependencies** section on the right, below **Notes**.
2. Click **Add Service Dependency**.
3. You will be directed to the service’s [Service Dependencies](/main/docs/service-profile#service-dependencies) page.
   * There are two sections to this page: other services that this service **uses** or is **used by**. Click **Edit Services** to add the appropriate dependency.
4. On the **Edit Services** screen, you may search by service name, or select one of the **Business Services** or **Technical Services** tabs. Click  to add the desired services; you may add multiple business and technical services. *Optional*: You may also create a new business or technical service on this screen by clicking **Create a new business service** or **Create a new technical service** from the corresponding tabs. This will open the [Business Service](/main/docs/business-services#create-a-business-service) or [Technical Service](/main/docs/services-and-integrations#create-a-new-service) configuration screen in a new tab.
5. Click **Save Changes**.
