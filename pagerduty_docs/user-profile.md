User Profile
============

Set up your Contact Information, Notification Rules, User Settings and manage Passwords

Your user profile is where you will configure important personal settings, such as contact information and notification rules to receive timely incident notifications.

To access your user profile:

1. In the web app, hover over your **User Icon** in the top right corner.
2. Select **My Profile**.

You can configure the following items in the user profile:

* [Contact Information](#contact-information): Enter your contact information and basic account information so you can be notified about PagerDuty incidents in a timely fashion.
* [Notification Rules](#notification-rules): Set up rules to determine how and when you’re notified about PagerDuty incidents.
* [User Settings](#user-settings): Configure login information and other account settings.
* [Permissions & Teams](#permissions--teams): Information about which Teams you’re on and associated permissions (Only available with [Advanced Permissions](/main/docs/advanced-permissions)).
* [On-Call Shifts](#on-call-shifts): Review when you’ll be on call and create overrides.
* [Subscriptions](#subscriptions): Manage your business service subscriptions.

Contact Information
===================

In the Contact Information tab of the user profile (**User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Contact Information**), you can add and edit basic contact information and personal details, as well as view recent account activity.

> 🚧 Required User Permissions
> ---------------------------
> 
> * All users can create, edit and delete their contact information.
> * Admins and Global Admins can create, edit and delete contact information for all users, except the Account Owner. The Account Owner can create, edit and delete all users’ contact information.

Edit Personal Information
-------------------------

To edit your, or another user's, personal information:

1. Navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Contact Information** tab.
   1. **Note**: To edit another user's personal information, navigate to **People**  **Users** and select the desired user's **name**.
2. Click the  icon to the right of your desired field:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | The user's name. |
| **Title** | Select a **Job Title** from the dropdown. **Note**: To enter a title that is not in the list, select **Other** and then type in your preferred title. |
| **Bio** | A text field for additional user information and/or background. |
| **Time Zone** | Select a time zone from the dropdown. Your time zone selection will be used to determine what time to display when reviewing on-call schedules, incident logs and your on-call shifts. |

3. Click **Save**.

Add a Contact Method
--------------------

Add contact methods that you would like to be notified at when an incident is assigned to you. The following contact methods are available:

* [Phone and Email](#add-a-phone-or-email-contact-method)
* [Slack](#add-a-slack-contact-method)
* [SMS](#add-an-sms-contact-method)

> 👍 Recommended
> -------------
> 
> We highly recommend that you:
> 
> * Set up **multiple contact methods**.
> * Ensure that your [notification sound settings are enabled](/main/docs/mobile-app-settings).
> 
> This reduces the chance that you will miss an incident notification.

To test that the connection between PagerDuty and your contact method is functioning, follow instructions in [Test a Contact Method](#test-a-contact-method).

Once you have added contact method(s), you must configure your [Notification Rules](#notification-rules), which determine how and when you will be notified about incidents.

**Note**: After adding a contact method, High-Urgency notification rules will automatically be configured. To make additional changes, please read [Edit a Notification Rule](#edit-a-notification-rule) or [Delete a Notification Rule](#delete-a-notification-rule).

> 📘 Maximum Number of Contact Methods
> -----------------------------------
> 
> Each user can have up to 10 different contact methods, however, users are limited to 3 phone numbers for phone notifications and 3 phone numbers for SMS.

### Add a Phone or Email Contact Method

To add phone or email contact methods:

1. Navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Contact Information** tab.
2. Follow the instructions for your preferred notification method:
   1. **Add Phone Number**: Enter the **phone number**, select the **phone number type** (e.g., Work, Mobile, etc.) from the dropdown. If needed, you can configure a [phone number with an extension](#phone-contact-methods-with-an-extension-or-delay).
   2. **Add Email Address**: Enter the **email address**, select the **email type** (e.g., Work, Home, etc.) from the dropdown. You may *optionally* select **Send Short Emails** if you would like short email notifications that are geared towards smaller devices like pagers or mobile phones. You may *optionally* select **Send HTML Emails** if you would like to receive HTML emails. If you leave both checkboxes unchecked, you will receive plain text emails. Please see our [Notification Content and Behavior](/main/docs/email-notifications) article for examples of HTML vs plain text emails.
3. Click **Save**.

#### Phone Contact Methods with an Extension or Delay

When configuring your phone notification methods, you may need to account for pauses, direct extensions, or key presses. You can achieve this by entering one or more commas (`,`), which each represent a one-second delay.

> 📘 Tip
> -----
> 
> Depending on your phone system, you may need to add commas for pauses before **AND** after your direct extension.

1. In the web app, go to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Contact Information** tab.
2. In the section **Phone**, click  to the right of the phone number you’d like to edit, *or* click **Add Phone Number**.
3. Enter your phone number, followed by a comma (`,`), then your extension.
4. Click **Save**.

![Contact method with an extension](https://files.readme.io/50637cd-image1.png "Contact method with an extension")



Contact method with an extension



#### Examples

| Scenario | Contact method entry | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phone notification method with a direct extension | `415-555-5555,1234` | PagerDuty will dial 415-555-5555, wait **one** second, then dial 1234. |
| Phone notification method with a direct extension (alternate) | `415-555-5555,,,1234` | PagerDuty will dial 415-555-5555, wait **three** seconds, then dial 1234. |
| Traverse a phone tree | `415-555-5555,,1,,,2,987` | PagerDuty will dial 415-555-5555, wait **two** seconds, dial 1, wait **three** seconds, dial 2, wait **one** second, then dial 987. |
| Leave a delay for "Please leave a message after the tone..." | `415-555-5555,,,,,,` | PagerDuty will dial 415-555-5555, wait **six** seconds , then leave a message. |

#### Phone Number Formatting

PagerDuty uses a third-party provider to validate phone numbers. Phone numbers may not exceed 40 characters, and may only include digits from 0–9 and the following symbols: comma (`,`), asterisk (`*`), and pound (`#`).

Providers in some countries require us to format numbers in a specific way. Due to limitations with local providers, we require all Mexico-based SMS contact methods to be free of area code prefixes. For example, our system will automatically remove the leading `1` in the phone number `+52 15558889999` and reformat it `+52 5558889999`. This improves deliverability and processing of SMS replies.

Additionally, we do not support [trunk prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_prefix) from the following countries and regions:

* France
* Romania
* UK
* Denmark
* Germany
* Australia
* Thailand
* India
* North America

You must remove trunk codes before adding a phone number as a contact method. For example, a UK-based number with local formatting `01332 412 251` must be formatted for international use without the leading `0`, i.e., `+44 1332 412251`. Trunk codes or prefixes vary by region, and may be different from the example provided.

### Add a Slack Contact Method

PagerDuty relies on a variety of third parties for notifications. We recommend that you always have a secondary contact method configured for backup to avoid delays due to availability, traffic or uptime. This ensures timely delivery of notifications when seconds matter.

For those customers using a free Slack account, there may be stricter rate limits on notifications that impact delivery.

> 🚧 Requirement
> -------------
> 
> You must have a PagerDuty Slack integration configured with Workspace and user account mapping. View the [Slack Integration Guide](/main/docs/slack-integration-guide) for more details.

To add a Slack contact method:

1. Navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Contact Information** tab.
2. Click **Add Slack workspace** and select your **Workspace** from the dropdown.
3. Click **Save**.

When you are assigned to an incident, you will receive an incident notification as a direct message from the PagerDuty Slack App. Please see our [Slack User Guide](/main/docs/slack-user-guide#incident-actions) for more information on how to respond to Slack incident notifications.

### Add an SMS Contact Method

In order to receive PagerDuty notifications via SMS, you must first verify your phone number. Verification codes are sent directly to the new SMS number and cannot be sent to other numbers or users for the verification process. Unverified phone numbers cannot receive SMS notifications.

To add an SMS contact method:

1. Navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile** and select the **Contact Information** tab.
2. Click **Add SMS Number**.
3. In the **Add SMS Number** modal, enter your **phone number**, select the **phone number type** (e.g., Work, Mobile, etc.) from the dropdown, and click **Send Verification**.

> 👍 Supported Countries
> ---------------------
> 
> Please read [Supported Countries](/main/docs/supported-countries#sms-notifications) for the list of countries where SMS notifications are supported. If you are in a country with partial support (i.e., marked with an asterisk, `*`) it is possible that you will not receive the verification message due to local regulations and circumstances beyond PagerDuty's control. You can click **Resend code** to try to receive another code, however we recommend using the [PagerDuty Mobile App](/main/docs/mobile-app) as a primary notification method, as push notifications are delivered much more reliably.

4. PagerDuty will send a verification code to your device; enter the six-digit code and click **Verify**.

### Test a Contact Method

You may wish to send a test notification to confirm that your contact method was added correctly.

To test a contact method:

1. Navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Contact Information** tab.
2. Click **Test** to the far right of the contact method you’d like to test.

The above method of testing will establish a connection between PagerDuty and your contact method, but it will not generate a test incident. If you wish to test a contact method using a test incident to get the full experience, you may also:

* [Trigger an incident](/main/docs/incidents#trigger-an-incident) on a service that uses an [escalation policy](/main/docs/escalation-policies) you are currently on-call for.
* [Add an Events API V2 integration](/main/docs/services-and-integrations#add-integrations-to-an-existing-service) to your service, which will provide a curl command to generate a test incident. For more information, please see our [API Reference](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/a7d81b0e9200f-create-an-incident).

Edit a Contact Method
---------------------

1. Navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Contact Information** tab.
2. Click  to the right of the contact method you’d like to change.
3. Make the required changes and click **Save**.

> 📘 Too Many Edits
> ----------------
> 
> You can edit contact methods up to 10 times within a 24-hour period. If you receive an error "Contact methods cannot be modified at this time," please wait 24 hours and try again

Delete a Contact Method
-----------------------

1. Navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Contact Information** tab.
2. Click  to the right of the contact method you’d like to delete. You will be prompted with a confirmation dialog.
3. Click **OK** to accept the confirmation.

View Mobile App Devices
-----------------------

Under **Mobile App** on your user profile, you can view which devices are registered to receive push notifications. A device is registered to receive push notifications when you [log in to the mobile app](/main/docs/mobile-app#log-in-to-the-mobile-app).

### Expired Mobile Devices

An **Expired** flag next to a mobile device means that you have not logged into or accessed the mobile app in some time. For security's sake, our system expires the token. To re-enable the device, please [remove the device as a contact method](/main/docs/user-profile#delete-a-contact-method) and [log in to your PagerDuty account](/main/docs/mobile-app#log-in-to-the-mobile-app) on the preferred device again.

View Recent User Activity
-------------------------

Below your contact information, you can view your activity for the past 14 days. This includes information about incidents that you acknowledged, resolved or manually triggered through the web application.

Notification Rules
==================

Notification rules determine how you will be notified when an incident is assigned to you. This applies to both the frequency of when you’re notified, as well as which methods will be used (push, phone call, SMS, email, and/or Slack). You can configure different sets of rules for high and low-urgency incidents, as well as when incidents change.

> 🚧 User Permissions
> ------------------
> 
> * All users can create, edit and delete their own notification rules.
> * Admins and Global Admins can create, edit and delete notification rules for all users except the Account Owner. The Account Owner can create, edit and delete notification rules of all users.

> 🚧 Requirement
> -------------
> 
> You must first [add contact methods](#add-a-contact-method) to your user profile to configure notification rules.

The following types of notification rules are available:

* **When someone invites me to respond to an incident**: Notification rule for being added as a responder to an incident.
* **When a high-urgency incident is assigned to me**: Notification rules for high-urgency incident assignments.
* **When a high-urgency incident assigned to me changes**: Notification rules for assigned high-urgency incidents that are acknowledged, escalated or resolved.
* **When a low-urgency incident is assigned to me**: Notification rules for low-urgency incident assignments.
* **When an incident I am subscribed to has a status update**: Notification rules for status updates on incidents you are subscribed to.
* **Before I go on-call or off-call**: Notification rules to update you when you are about to go on or off-call.

> 👍 Best Practice
> ---------------
> 
> We strongly recommend adding multiple channels for your notification rules. Push notifications have the highest reliability metrics of all delivery methods, so in the event that a 3rd-party SMS or voice carrier has an outage, having a push contact method means we will still be able to notify you.

When someone invites me to respond to an incident
-------------------------------------------------

When a user requests your help as a responder on an incident, PagerDuty sends  

[responder notifications](/main/docs/add-responders#responder-notifications) using your [**high-urgency** notification rules](#when-a-high-urgency-incident-is-assigned-to-me).

When you receive a responder notification, you’ll be prompted to **accept** or **decline** the request.

When a high-urgency incident is assigned to me
----------------------------------------------

Create notification rules for high-urgency incident assignments.

1. Navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Notification Rules** tab.
2. Under the section **When a high-urgency incident is assigned to me...** click **Add Notification Rule**.
3. Enter the **number of minutes** PagerDuty should wait before sending the notification.

* The default is **0 minutes**, which will notify you immediately.

4. Select the **contact method** that you would like to be notified on.

* You can use the same contact method in multiple notification rules.

5. Click **Save**.

> 👍 Stagger Notification Rules
> ----------------------------
> 
> We recommend setting a short delay between your notification rules so that you are not notified at the same time on each contact method.
> 
> For example:
> 
> * A push notification **immediately** (0 minutes) after assignment
> * A phone call notification after **1 minute**
> * A Slack notification after **2 minutes**
> * An email notification after **3 minutes**
> * An SMS notification after **4 minutes**
> 
> **Note**: If a user sets a delay on a notification rule that is greater than an escalation policy's [escalation timeout](/main/docs/escalation-policies#escalation-timeout), and an incident escalates to the *same* user at the next escalation level, the user can expect to receive notifications from the previous escalation level once the configured delay period elapses.

When a high-urgency incident assigned to me changes
---------------------------------------------------

You can create notification rules so that you receive a message any time one of your high-urgency incidents changes status (i.e., acknowledged, resolved or escalated).

1. In the web app, navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Notification Rules** tab.
2. Under the section **When any of my high-urgency incidents change...** click **Add Notification Rule**.
3. In the first dropdown, select which **incident state** you’d like to be notified about:

* Available choices are **acknowledged**, **resolved** or **escalated**.

4. In the second dropdown, select the **contact method** to notify.
5. Click **Save**.

In order for PagerDuty to deliver a notification related to a *status change* on one of your incidents, you must have already received a standard *high-urgency notification* on that channel. As an example, if you configure notification rules to notify you after 1 minute, and your incident is acknowledged, resolved or escalated within that time frame (by another user or via the API, for example), you should not expect to receive a notification related to the status change.

Additionally, if you acknowledge or resolve your own incident, you will not receive a notification related to the status change, even if you have a rule configured.

When a low-urgency incident is assigned to me
---------------------------------------------

1. Navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Notification Rules** tab.
2. Under the section **When a low-urgency incident is assigned to me...** click **Add Notification Rule**.
3. Enter the **number of minutes** PagerDuty should wait before sending the notification.

* The default is **0 minutes**, which would notify you immediately.

4. Select the **contact method** that you would like to be notified on.

* You can use the same contact method in multiple notification rules.

5. Click **Save**.

When an incident I am subscribed to has a status update
-------------------------------------------------------

Configure notification preferences for status updates when [subscribed](/main/docs/communicate-with-stakeholders#add-subscribers-to-an-incident) to an incident.

1. In the web app, navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Notification Rules** tab.
2. Under the section **When an incident I am subscribed to has a status update...**, click **Add Notification Rule**.
3. In the dropdown, select a contact method and click **Save**.

Feel free to repeat the steps above for other contact methods.

Multiple methods can be configured by repeating this step. If you would like to edit or remove a contact method, click the  or the **X** to the right of the method.

On-Call Handoff Notifications
-----------------------------

On-call handoff notifications (OCHONs) can notify you up to 48 hours before you go on-call, off-call, or both. These notifications can only be sent as a push notification or email.

> ❗️ End of Life: OCHONs via SMS
> ------------------------------
> 
> We will no longer support delivery of on-call hand off notifications (OCHONs) via SMS for new users.
> 
> * If you have already configured your OCHONs to deliver via push or email contact methods, we will stop delivery of SMS notifications on September 10, 2024.
> * If you haven't configured your OCHONs to deliver via alternate contact methods, we will stop delivery of SMS notifications on December 10, 2024. Please follow the instructions below to configure push and/or email notification methods for your OCHONs.

> 🚧 Requirements
> --------------
> 
> To send OCHONs, the following three conditions must be met:
> 
> 1. You must have on-call handoff notifications configured in your User Profile (instructions below).
> 2. You must be a [target](/main/docs/escalation-policies#escalation-targets) on an escalation policy.
> 3. The escalation policy must have OCHONs turned on. If the escalation policy is attached to a service, the OCHONs will always be turned on. If it is not attached to a service, follow instructions to turn them on in our [Escalation Policy Basics](/main/docs/escalation-policies#on-call-handoff-notification-settings) article.

To configure on-call handoff notifications:

1. In the web app, navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Notification Rules** tab.
2. Under the section **Before I go on-call or off-call...**, click **Add Notification Rule**.
3. Enter the following information:
   * The **number of hours** before your shift that you would like to be notified.
   * Whether you want to be notified before going **on-call**, **off-call** or **both**.
   * The **contact method** to notify (mobile app push notification or email).
4. Click **Save**.

Edit a Notification Rule
------------------------

Edit any notification rule with these steps:

1. In the web app, navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Notification Rules** tab.
2. Click  to the right of the notification rule you’d like to change.
3. Make the required changes and click **Save**.

Delete a Notification Rule
--------------------------

1. In the web app, navigate to **User Icon**  **My Profile**  **Notification Rules** tab.
2. Click  to the right of the notification rule you’d like to delete.
   * You’ll be prompted with a confirmation.
3. Accept the confirmation.

Temporarily Disable Notifications
---------------------------------

If you go on vacation or will be unavailable for a time we recommend [creating an override](/main/docs/edit-schedules#create-overrides) for any schedule for which you are on-call. This ensures that there is coverage if an incident is assigned to you while you are not available to address the incident.

You can create overrides in the PagerDuty website, mobile app, or [via our API](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODE4OA-create-one-or-more-overrides).

If you want to make sure that you do not receive any PagerDuty notifications when you go on vacation or are unavailable to be on-call, you may also [remove your notification rules](#delete-a-notification-rule).

> 📘 Heads up
> ----------
> 
> Removing notification rules does NOT mean that incidents cannot be assigned to you. Incidents can still be assigned and [reassigned](/main/docs/reassign-incidents#reassign-an-incident) to you even if you do not have any notification rules as long as you are still on-call on a schedule or part of an escalation policy. By deleting your notification rules, you will simply avoid being notified of these incidents.
> 
> Also, note that removing your notification rules will NOT remove your contact methods. When you are ready to receive notifications again, you can go back to your profile page and re-add notification rules.
