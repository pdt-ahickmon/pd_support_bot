   * **How much did services cost over a period of time?**: Response Effort, Incident Count, Uptime, Notification Count, MTTR, MTTA, Responder Count.
2. You may optionally filter with the following parameters:

* **Team**: You can filter further by selecting the **My Teams** tab or **All Teams** tab or search for your preferred teams. Select each preferred Team’s **checkbox** and click **Apply**.
* **Urgency**: Select from **All**, **High** or **Low** urgency incidents.
* **Priority**: Select from **All** or any of your account’s [preconfigured priority levels](/main/docs/incident-priority#enabling-incident-priority).
* **Date Range**: Select from **Last 30 Days**, **Last 7 Days**, **Last Month**, **This Month** or **Custom Range**. If you select **Custom Range**, select the range on the calendar and click **Apply**. **Note**: For custom ranges, you can select dates up to three years in the past.

Response Cost for Services
--------------------------

The Business Impact tab provides you with insights on the estimated response cost for your selected Teams and services. By default, the estimated cost per responder hour is set to $50. If you would like to change your estimated cost per responder hour, you can enter that in the **Estimated Cost ($/hour)** field and a new total value will be calculated based on that cost and the **Total Response Hours**.

Services List Table
-------------------

Below the Response Cost for Services table you will see the **Services List** data specific to the filters you have selected. You may perform the following actions with this table:

* **Search**: Use the search field to search for specific data.
* **Sort**: Click on a column header to sort results. You can also sort with multiple columns by holding down the shift key while clicking on both of the columns.
* **Drill Down**: Click a service or a Team in the **Service** or **Team** columns to view more information about each.

The available Services List columns are:

* **Business Services**: The Business Service(s) mapped to each service.
* **Service**: The service name.
* **Team**: The Team each service belongs to. Teams allow users to group and control user access to associated PagerDuty objects, such as escalation policies, users, schedules and services.
* **Response Effort**: The total engaged time across all responders, measured from the time a responder acknowledges or accepts a responder request until the incident is resolved.
* **Incidents**: The total count of incidents that occurred on the service within the specified time period.
* **Uptime %**: The inverse of the time (in %) during which the service had an active [major incident](/main/docs/operational-reviews#major-incidents). A major incident is defined as the top two levels of your [priority](/main/docs/incident-priority) settings, or if [multiple responders are added](/main/docs/add-responders#add-responders-to-an-incident) and acknowledge.
* **Notifications**: The total count of incident notifications sent via push, email, phone call and SMS.
* **MTTR**: The average time from when an incident was created until it was resolved.
* **MTTA**: The average time between when an incident is first assigned to a user and when the incident is first acknowledged by that user. Reassign, resolve, and escalation actions do not imply acknowledgement.
* **Responders**: The total count of responders assigned per service.

By default, the Services List display 10 results at a time. Use the dropdown below the table to select from 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 results per page. If there are more results than the selected dropdown value, you can use the arrows (i.e., , , , ) to navigate through results.

### Share the Business Impact Report

Please read [Share a Report](#share-a-report) below for more information on sharing or exporting the report.

Filter Limits
=============

Each report has the following filter limits:

* **Service, Responder, and Escalation Policy Filters**: 1000
* **Team Filter**: 200

When the count of filtered objects goes over the limit, the list will grey out and you can no longer select/deselect individual objects. You will need to click **Clear** at the top of the filter list in order to select filters again.

If you think you will overshoot the limit, we recommend:

1. Use the **Team** filter first to reduce the number of Escalation Policies/Services/Responders.
2. Once the list is below 1000, you can deselect from there.

Share a Report
==============

There are two ways to share Insights reports:

* [Share button](#share-button)

Export CSV
----------

> 📘 Export Size Limit
> -------------------
> 
> Depending on your pricing plan, there is a limit to the number of rows you can export.
> 
> If your exported report exactly matches the limit, it is likely that your data has been truncated. You can reference your report in the PagerDuty web app to see the total count (e.g., **Total Incidents**). We recommend adding filters, or adjusting the date range, to reduce results, and exporting in batches as needed.
> 
> | Pricing Plan | Export Limit |
> | --- | --- |
> | **Professional**, **Business** | 100,000 rows |
> | **Enterprise Incident Management**, **Digital Operations**(legacy) | 250,000 rows |

  

To export a report as a `.csv` file, click **Export CSV** to generate a file, which will keep the view and results based on your search and filter selections.
