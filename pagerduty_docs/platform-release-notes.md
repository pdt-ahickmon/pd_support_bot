Platform Release Notes
======================

February 2025
=============

Use a single Slack app to manage all your PagerDuty incidents
-------------------------------------------------------------

You can now use a single PagerDuty Slack app to access all the functionality you need to manage incidents in the chat, from detection to learning! This includes the generative AI capabilities of PagerDuty Advance and the ability to ingest Slack data into your Post-incident Reviews. Take [this product tour](https://pagerduty.navattic.com/guided_remediation_slack) or watch [this demo](https://youtu.be/2ql5xfWmM7k?si=C3d2e9a9q5UwKC5j) to learn more. Generally available.

January 2025
============

Intune Support for Mobile is Now in Early Access
------------------------------------------------

With Intune support for Mobile, customers can more securely manage the PagerDuty Mobile app while improving compliance with regulations and policies. Intune’s Mobile App Management (MAM) capabilities allow organizations to enforce policies like blocking copy/paste between unmanaged apps, encrypting data, remotely wiping devices, and more. This helps organizations protect revenue by reducing data breach risks and improving compliance. Enterprise Incident Management (EIM) customers can [sign up for Early Access](https://www.pagerduty.com/early-access/).

New SMS contact method verification
-----------------------------------

To combat SMS phishing, we’re introducing a 6-digit code verification for new phone numbers added to accounts. Users can now have up to 3 SMS/Voice contacts while existing numbers remain unaffected. This ensures critical notifications reach verified numbers, reducing fraud risks. [Learn more](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/user-profile#add-an-sms-contact-method).

Zendesk Field Mapping with PagerDuty Custom Fields
--------------------------------------------------

Share contextual information seamlessly between Zendesk and PagerDuty to save time during incidents. [Learn more](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/zendesk-custom-field-mappings).

Automation on Alerts now in Early Access for AIOps customers
------------------------------------------------------------

Proactively address issues before they escalate into incidents. Automation on Alerts allows teams to trigger automated remediation workflows at the alert level, reducing the need for responder intervention and preventing incidents from being created in the first place. By resolving issues earlier in the lifecycle, teams can reduce the total number of incidents, minimize customer impact, and free up time for value-add work. AIOps customers can sign up for [Early Access](https://www.pagerduty.com/early-access/).

Auto-pause Incident Notifications with Recommended Pause Time Now Available for AIOps Customers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selecting the right pause time for Auto-pause Incident Notifications (APIN) just got easier. AIOps customers can now see the recommended pause time directly in the dropdown menu, helping the optimal pause time for transient noise. This enhancement helps prevent unnecessary incident noise by pausing transient alerts more effectively and reduces the need for manual adjustments. [Learn more](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/auto-pause-incident-notifications).

Global Intelligent Alert Grouping now Generally Available
---------------------------------------------------------

AIOps customers can use PagerDuty’s proprietary machine learning algorithms to learn from both system and human data when grouping alerts for noise reduction across multiple services. Reduce operating costs and improve your incident response by focusing on critical signals, thanks to this intelligent automation. Available now for all AIOps customers. [Learn more](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/global-alert-grouping#intelligent).

End of Life for Event Rules on January 31
-----------------------------------------

The End of Life for Event Rules will happen on January 31. You can continue to use and edit your Event Rules in the UI as usual until the EOL date. Starting February 1, Event Rules will be available via API only. If you’re currently using Event Rules, you will receive an email about potential migration paths. Otherwise, no action is required. To get the most value out of PagerDuty's event-driven automation offering, we recommend migrating to Event Orchestration. Event Orchestration is the best way for users to compress rule volumes, improve noise reduction, and automate manual work. Users will be able to do everything in Event Orchestration that they can in Event Rules today, and more. Read the [Knowledge Base article](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/migrate-to-event-orchestration).

December 2024
=============

Generally available: API for managing incident Slack channels
-------------------------------------------------------------

We released [new public API endpoints](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/56fee4184eabc-pager-duty-slack-integration-api) to create, update and remove both incident and notification Slack channels. This provides greater flexibility to integrate any homegrown automation processes with PagerDuty and to seamlessly collaborate and coordinate incident response. Generally available for Incident Management customers.

New Incident Workflow action: add Slack channel bookmark
--------------------------------------------------------

Automatically bookmark important resources to an incident’s dedicated channel, such as runbooks, dashboards, ITSM tickets, or other process documentation. This provides responders with instant access to key data right where they work—in chat. Please note you need to [refresh the PagerDuty Slack app authorization](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/slack-integration-guide#reauthorization) to get access to this feature. Generally available for Business and Enterprise Incident Management customers. Learn more [here](https://support.pagerduty.com/actions/docs/add-a-bookmark).

Operations Console with Alert Side Panel Early Access Now Available for AIOps customers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The new alert side panel provides real-time visibility into alerts and their associated metadata, centralizing key information for easier triage. With the newest enhancements, responders can view and customize the alert table directly from the side panel, take action on alerts (e.g. merge/unmerge), and add new columns (e.g. # of alerts, latest alert time, alert CEF fields) to the live incidents table. Additionally, we've added Incident Custom Fields where users can customize, free-text search and live filter for incidents, and automation functions such as sync with ServiceNow (via Webhook v3). Customers can save time, reduce costs, and improve efficiency by centralizing alert data and eliminating the need for tab-switching. With better visibility and enriched data, teams can reduce MTTA and MTTR, protect revenue, and handle incidents with greater precision. AIOps customers can sign up for [Early Access](https://www.pagerduty.com/early-access/).

New Webhooks Public SSL Client Certificates available starting Dec 6, 2024
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The new public SSL Client Certificates used by PagerDuty Webhooks are now available. If your process relies on these certificates, please ensure your servers are configured to verify the new certificate. Alternatively, as a best practice, use an up-to-date trusted root CA certificate list to avoid service disruptions. Learn more here and contact [support@pagerduty.com](mailto:support@pagerduty.com) if you have questions.

The Escalation Policies details page got a new look!
----------------------------------------------------

We're enhancing the Escalation Policies (EPs) details page! Expect more detailed error messaging, better formatting, responsive design, and improved navigation, including a direct link to the service directory for easier EPs additions and seamless mobilization. [Learn more](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/escalation-policies).

Improved Webhook Delivery Reliability with Extended Retry Window
----------------------------------------------------------------

PagerDuty Webhooks now have an extended retry window of 48 hours, a significant improvement from the previous 20-minute window. This change reduces the risk of message loss during scheduled maintenance windows or temporary service interruptions of target systems, ultimately reducing the risk and cost of major operational failures.  

This change applies to all customers using PagerDuty webhooks, but no immediate action is required. We encourage customers to review their webhook handling processes to accommodate the extended delivery window.

End of Life for Event Rules Coming January 2025
-----------------------------------------------

The End of Life for Event Rules will happen on January 31, 2025. You can continue to use and edit your Event Rules in the UI as usual until the EOL date. Starting February 1, 2025, Event Rules will be available via API only. If you’re currently using Event Rules, you will receive an email about potential migration paths. Otherwise, no action is required. To get the most value out of PagerDuty's event-driven automation offering, we recommend migrating to Event Orchestration. Event Orchestration is the best way for users to compress rule volumes, improve noise reduction, and automate manual work. Users will be able to do everything in Event Orchestration that they can in Event Rules today, and more. Read the [Knowledge Base article](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/migrate-to-event-orchestration).

November 2024
=============

Status Page Automation migration to Incident Workflows now Generally Available.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configure status page incident workflows created for status pages with automated incident posts enabled to post new incidents and send updates to the status page when set conditions with Incident workflow triggers are met.

Manage incidents end-to-end from the chat with new Slack features!
------------------------------------------------------------------

Explore a revamped PagerDuty Slack experience, built to streamline incident management in chat, reducing costs and risks in response coordination and communication. New capabilities include:

* The ability to create public or private Slack channels exclusively dedicated to one incident, and link up to 3 notification channels to keep dedicated channels uncluttered
* The ability to trigger *any* incident action with simple slash commands
* Intuitive and interactive help commands (/pd or /pd help) that support planned and unplanned work and provide access to the full directory of slash commands, clickable buttons, and recommended actions.

Available from November 26 for all customers using the PagerDuty Slack app. Learn more [here](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/slack-user-guide#dedicated-channel).

Intelligent Alert Grouping with Advanced Options is now Generally Available!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build more dynamic alert groupings using advanced options that leverage metadata fields for textual similarity analysis. Choose up to five fields, including standard CEF (Common Event Format) and custom details. Provide better context and relevance to decrease alert noise, and reduce operating costs thanks to our intelligent automation. Available now for all AIOps customers. Learn more [here](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/intelligent-alert-grouping#advanced-options).

Noise Reduction Home Page Now Available for Early Access
--------------------------------------------------------

This centralized hub offers a high-level overview of services and their alert grouping configurations, enabling users to implement noise reduction recommendations and make configuration edits seamlessly. Accelerate resolution and reduce operating costs by streamlining alert management and avoiding unnecessary disruptions. Available for AIOps customers only. [Sign up for early access now](https://www.pagerduty.com/early-access/)!

Start a Post-incident Review with a genAI summary directly from chat with PagerDuty Advance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the PagerDuty Advance Assistant within Slack or Microsoft Teams to create an AI-generated executive summary of the incident that is automatically imported into a new Jeli Post-incident Review. Get a jump-start on learning from incidents to build more resilient operations and improve customer experience. Generally available to Enterprise Incident Management customers using Jeli and PagerDuty Advance. Learn more [here](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/pagerduty-advance#pagerduty-advance-for-post-incident-reviews).

EOL for Event Rules on January 31, 2025
---------------------------------------

The Event Rules UI will reach End of Life on January 31, 2025. After this date, Event Rules will be accessible via API only. Users are encouraged to migrate to Event Orchestration for enhanced event-driven automation capabilities. Event Orchestration offers improved functionality over Event Rules, including better UI, advanced conditions, rule nesting, and Terraform support.

Status Page Automation with Incident Worflows now Generally Available
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Automate a consistent set of information to your status page to keep end users informed during customer-impacting outages with PagerDuty status pages and incident workflows. Teams can now set up incident workflows to post new incidents and send updates to the status page when set conditions with Incident workflow triggers are met. This automation helps reduce the risk of human error and the cost of major operational failures. Generally available to PagerDuty Status Page and EIM customers. [Learn more](https://support.pagerduty.com/actions/docs/incident-workflow-actions-overview).

Generally available: PagerDuty Advance for Microsoft Teams, Analytics, and more!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PagerDuty Advance capabilities are now available for Microsoft Teams, including the brand-new ability to access Knowledge Base information directly from the chat. This reduces operational complexity for teams looking for support beyond unplanned work, driving efficiency, and mitigating the risk of operational failure.  

Also generally available: a new Analytics dashboard providing clear visibility into improvements on operational metrics supported by genAI, enabling data-driven decision-making to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. Available for customers on a PagerDuty Advance paid plan or [trial](https://www.pagerduty.com/try-pagerduty-advance/).

New Incident Workflow Action: Create Post-incident Review
---------------------------------------------------------

Users can add Post-incident Reviews as an action to their Incident Workflows to automatically initiate the learning process upon incident resolution. This helps teams identify patterns across incidents and turns them into opportunities to drive continuous improvement, ultimately mitigating the risk of operational failure by learning and improving processes over time. Generally available on the Enterprise plan for Incident Management. Learn more [here](https://support.pagerduty.com/actions/docs/jeli-create-a-post-incident-review).

Event Orchestration External Data Variables now in Early Access!
----------------------------------------------------------------

Teams can now initiate actions based on existing automation outputs, such as suppressing unnecessary incidents when the diagnostics results indicate the issue has been resolved, reducing total cost of operations and freeing up time for value-add work. [Sign up for Early Access](https://www.pagerduty.com/early-access/) (AIOps customers only).

Terraform support now available for all Alert Grouping Settings APIs

End of Life for Event Rules Coming January 2025
-----------------------------------------------
