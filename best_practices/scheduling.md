Title - Multiple people on-call at the same time

Synonyms - Entire team on-call, Overlapping schedules

Description - Creating a schedule that enables multiple team members to be on-call at the same time but have different shift timings for more complex schedules.

Steps
1. Since we need multiple people to be on-call at the same time we need to create a schedule for each person's working hours. Create a schedule for the first person and add them as the only user.
2. The rotation and handoff time settings doesn't matter as this schedule only has one person in it.
3. Add restrictions to the schedule for the specific shift time, if this person is on-call all days of the week and at the same time then use the option: Restrict on-call duty to specific times-of-the-day. If the person is on-call not all days in the week or has different shift times on different days then use the option to Restrict on-call duty to specific times-of-the-week.
4. Review the schedule below and ensure the shifts are accurrate then save.
5. Follow the same process for creating a schedule for each on-call person.
6. To notify the individuals that are on-call when there is an incident you need to know create an escalation policy. Add the schedules you created to the different layers of your esclaation, if any team members should be notified after the others then put them on the lower layers of the escalation.
